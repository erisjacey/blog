Megan and I went for Westlife's latest tour in Singapore. This was only the second concert I've been to, literally one day after my first (Phoebe Bridgers'). The past 2 days were truly a treat to say the least.

The [set list](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/westlife/2023/asiaworld-arena-islands-district-hong-kong-sar-china-5bbab750.html) the band used featured mostly their hits from the past, with a few features from the latest album.

Credits to Tanat Pruett for the following recording of Westlife performing Flying Without Wings tonight:

# My thoughts

I thought this concert was a completely different but equally intimate vibe from the previous night's. While yesterday had a bit more of a somber undertone, tonight was full of nostalgia. I remember listening to Westlife when I was still a kid, so it was definitely an amazing experience to see them in the flesh, still going strong and performing the songs I've loved for most of my life.

Hearing Shane's amazing voice in real life was basically a new core memory unlocked for me. I was also really glad that Mark was well and could come to perform despite battling recent health issues.
