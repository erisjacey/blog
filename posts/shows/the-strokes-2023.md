I'd only attended 2 other concerts prior to this one, but this was the first one I was attending alone. There weren't gonna be seats either, so considering these circumstances, I was expecting a wildly different concert experience this time around. I was just as excited for it though!

I was kind of expecting a similar [set list](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-strokes/2023/sands-expo-and-convention-centre-singapore-singapore-5ba42368.html) to the one they used the day before, but they [actually changed it quite a bit](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-strokes/2023/sands-expo-and-convention-centre-singapore-singapore-5ba4236c.html). I was very pleasantly surprised to see them play *Take It or Leave It* and *Ize of the World*, two songs I don't think they really have been playing at least recently.

# My thoughts

I unfortunately had to miss the Arctic Monkeys concert in March due to being afflicted with brokestudent-itis, so I really wanted to go for this one. This was the most hyped I had been for a concert thus far, and I can honestly say The Strokes' live performance exceeded my expectations. I was just blown away by how good the band sounded live.

I usually associate my favourite albums with a particular journey/place. I have very fond memories of playing *Is This It* from start to finish during my weekly bus rides to camp when I was still serving in the Singapore army. At the time, the playthroughs would provide me just a little bit of solace in lieu of the boring week ahead.

Honestly, out of the 3 concerts I have been to now, this one was probably my favourite. The feeling of jumping around and screaming the lyrics to every song with people I was standing very close to was simply an awesome experience I never had before. I felt connected to everyone in the concert hall even though I didn't know anyone. It sure more than made up for the pain I felt in my ears and feet after :)
