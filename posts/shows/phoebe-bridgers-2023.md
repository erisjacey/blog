My buddy Clement and I went for Phoebe Bridgers' first tour in Singapore. This was the first concert I have ever gone for as well, so this was pretty special to me. I'd even listened to nothing but her songs (and Westlife's) in the past few months to prepare for this :)

The [set list](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/phoebe-bridgers/2023/esplanade-theatre-singapore-singapore-2bbaa88e.html) Phoebe used was the standard in her current tour, except that she actually squeezed in *Sidelines* towards the end of her set! Apparently, some dude approach her in a coffee shop and requested that she play it. Shoutout to that guy honestly, and to Phoebe for actually following through on his request.

# My thoughts

Obviously I had no other concerts to compare tonight to, but I really had an amazing time. It was pretty surreal to surround myself with other dedicated fans, and to actually see and hear an artist I've been listening to only in recordings prior.

In my mind, she has cemented herself as really down-to-earth and relatable, with a few of her monologues in between songs opening up about her past struggles with mental health. I'm very much looking forward to following her career and hopefully being able to see her live again.

Hearing *Moon Song* live especially got me good. It's my absolute favourite song of hers and she did it immense justice tonight. I was considering taking a recording of it to store as a personal keepsake, but I'm so glad I decided to just immerse myself for those few minutes.
