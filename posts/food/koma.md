To celebrate my brother's birthday, his girlfriend, my family, several relatives, Megan and I went to [KOMA](https://komasingapore.com/) for lunch. This restaurant by Tao Group Hospitality is, according to Google, a "Japanese restaurant and sushi bar offering a modern interpretation of Japanese cuisine". It is supposed to be known for its immaculate vibes, albeit with a menu carrying heftier price tags. Despite the latter, after getting past the hallway adorned with what I had assumed was inspired by the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto, I was blown away by how lavish the interior design of the restaurant looked. 

Unfortunately, I didn't take many pics of the decor at the beginning, because I was too hungry to take my time in appreciating it.

After being seated, I noticed that instead of generic chopstick rests, the restaurant decided to go with seemingly hand-made paper cranes. I thought it was pretty cute.

All of us each opted for the [3-course set lunch menu](https://komasingapore.com/menus/lunch/), which consisted of an appetiser, main, and dessert, in that order. I was too lazy to meticulously note down what everyone had ordered, so I decided to just document what Megan and I had had.

# Course 1: appetiser

To start, I got the *snow crab cream croquette* (which I had to pay a little extra for). I was really impressed by the fried exterior of the croquette upon my first bite, combined with its soft and creamy filling, and finally the acidic hint of lemon that really tied the entire flavour altogether. I thought they were pretty generous with how much crab they put in the croquette. And it seemed to have a really subtle and tasty truffle aftertaste.

At the end of the day though, one can say it's just a fried croquette, so it's nothing much to write home about.

Megan, on the other hand, chose the *sashimi*, which also carried an additional cost. She had initially had no expectations, because she thought the restaurant seemed gimmicky, but she was also just as impressed by her appetiser, and especially the swordfish and tuna. I tried one of the tuna pieces, and I, too, thought it was sufficiently thick and fatty. The only real drawback was in its portioning. There were only 5 pieces in total from 3 different kinds of fish, and the pieces themselves weren't that big.

The last thing worth mentioning would be the authenticity of the wasabi used; they carried way bigger of a kick than the ones you would see in packets at cheaper sushi restaurants.

# Course 2: main

As a preamble, each dish in the section came with a bowl of steamed rice, apart from the *truffle fried rice*.

For my main, I decided to go with 2 pieces of the *miso marinated black cod*. I thought the fish was really succulent and well-marinated with the miso, which I thought was an interesting choice for a marinade. It was really well cooked too; it felt like it melted in my mouth. Similar to the *sashimi*, however, I wish they gave me more fish to soak in the delicious miso sauce because I felt like it wasn't enough.

Megan had the *truffle fried rice*. She had mixed feelings about the dish, and thought it maybe was a bit too salty and had too many mushrooms. When I had a taste, though, I thought it was bland and maybe was not truffle-y enough. Or was the "truffle" flavour in chips and cheaper restaurants not actually authentic? I'm not sure (I'm not some professional food critic or anything). In any case, we surmised that at least in the seasoning department, the rice wasn't consistently salted, which was definitely a disappointment.

# Course 3: dessert

As a cheese cake lover, I opted for the *Japanese cheese cake*. The strawberry theme of this dish did not feel overwhelming, and the cake itself felt light and creamy on the whole. It didn't have the texture of a classic New York cheese cake, or even a standard Japanese cheese cake, and some might even describe it as having a pudding-like texture, but it was just as decadent as any other cheese cake I have had. I thought it was excellent.

Megan hesitantly chose the *lemon yuzu* (I said hestitantly because she wasn't a huge fan of any of the dessert choices). It was basically a lemon mousse with yuzu jam perched on some cacao crumble. We both thought it was just alright; I give the dish extra points because of its immaculate presentation with cleverly hiding the mousse in a very realistic-looking lemon shell, but we thought the dish was maybe a bit too sour at times. The cacao crumble balanced this tangy flavour pretty well though.

While I thought the first two courses felt small in terms of portion size, the dessert was a whole 'nother story. It felt like they were trying to compensate for the tininess of the appetiser and main by giving us a massive dessert. By the end, I was really stuffed, and I really didn't expect that.

# My thoughts

Unfortunately, I didn't take many pics of the decor at the end, because I was too full to take my time in appreciating it. I also really needed to pee.

Overall, I would say that this restaurant was probably a one-and-done for me. The interior adornment was definitely unique and lended itself to a very authentic atmosphere, but personally, the food is what makes a restaurant great for me. And while it was delicious, I felt like I could've gotten better experience in that department in other similarly-priced restaurants. Or maybe we just ordered the wrong food. I don't know.

All I can say is, I'm quite mad I didn't take the opportunity to try out their toilet, which was apparently Japanese-styled as well, with all the fancy buttons and stuff. Plus points for authenticity there, I guess.
