Megan and I went for [an immersive dining experience](https://www.andsoforth.com.sg/around-the-world-in-8o-days) by [Andsoforth](https://www.andsoforth.com.sg/).

Some details about the event: it's a book analysis workshop based on Jules Verne's "Around the World in 80 Days". We were taken to several uniquely-designed rooms, each of which depicts a particular scene in the book. In each room, we were served a dish (or drink) that best fit that room's aesthetic/theme. The facilitator in each room also conducted a fun activity that ranged from cocktail making to a trivia game.

# Station 1: Gaiety Theatre

In this first station, we were introduced to how this experience was gonna work, as well as some background about the story itself, including the main character and the story synopsis. Of course, to start the night off right, we were served a glass of gin and tonic, but with the catch that we had to make it ourselves!

The cocktail making crash course was short and sweet and the cocktail itself was strong but I wish we had enough ingredients for more than one glass :)

# Station 2: On the ship "The Mongolian"

The scene reimagined here was onboard a ship, so naturally the activity conducted here was a knot tying workshop. We were taught how to tie a bowline knot and handcuff knot, so if it wasn't made obvious this place wasn't the most family-friendly in the previous room, it definitely was here.

As sort of an appetiser, we were served a pretty scrupmtious seafood soup. I thought the soup itself was rich and thick, all the seafood was tender and the bread was crunchy and seasoned well.

# Station 3: In a jungle in India

We next found ourselves in the jungle. The facilitator here explained more of what happened in the book but I wasn't really listening because I was honestly quite buzzed from the cocktail (I had to finish Megan's drink because I didn't wanna waste it).

I did think the masala chicken wrapped in thosai was the best of all the food served. Indian food is simply the best.

The activity here was a pretty cute demonstration of how to make cups from leaves.

# Station 4: On the Kowloon train

We were now on a train. The facilitator taught us some 19th century lingo and provided us with a postcard and pen to write to our partner/friend.

More story exposition followed, but at this point the entire room was more interested in what were going to be served. After about a million wrong guesses, we were finally told it was gonna be dim sum and knife cut noodles (刀削面). This was Megan's favourite; I thought it was pretty good too.

# Station 5: In a coal mine to Yokohama, Japan

In the next station, we found ourselves in some coal mine. The caveat here was that this was not actually in the book. The actual scene was another ship; the creators of this workshop just didn't want another repeat of the same scene.

We were served some Japanese fried rice topped with soft-shell crab, which was all delicious. The facilitator then served us a cup of sake each and gave some background on how it's made with samples of the rice during the fermentation process. I thought the sake was really good, but like in the first station I wish there had been more.

The transition to the next room here was really interesting. There was a mine cart that we had to enter, and inside we had to pull on a rope to transport the cart and ourselves to a staircase that led to the next room.

# Station 6: Circus

In this part of the story, the main character's assistant found himself working at a circus, so we were naturally served some popcorn ice cream. I thought the ice cream was adequately sweet and great. The few of us who were celebrating our birthdays also had a cute mini-celebration here!

We were also treated to a pretty cool trapeze demonstration by two trapeze performers. I was hoping we could try our hands at trapeze, but it only ended up being a photo taking session...

# Station 7: End of the road

This was the only room without food being served, but I guess it was to be expected after the last room's dessert. Instead, the facilitator just did a recap of the story through a mini trivia game. I thought it was quite funny that Megan and I couldn't follow most of the story. I think we were mostly preoccupied with looking forward to the food in each station and actually eating it.

## My thoughts

This was the definitely one of the more unique dining experiences I've had so far. It's especially fun to go with a partner or even a close friend or two. While I thought the food was pretty good, it wasn't mind blowing or anything. On top of that, we had a pretty late lunch that day and I still wasn't super full at the end of the course.

The variety in room designs and cuisines definitely enhance the experience though. I would heartily recommend going for at least one of Andsoforth's events!
