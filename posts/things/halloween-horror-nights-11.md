Megan and I went to [this year's Halloween Horror Nights 11](https://www.rwsentosa.com/en/promotions/attractions/hhn11), a specially-curated experience held at Universal Studios Singapore for individuals with an appreciation for the macabre and scary. *Or like in my case, for those whose partners have an **interesting** taste in entertainment.*

This was our 2nd time going to this event together (and my 4th time collectively), so we had a pretty good idea of what to expect.

This year, the event has seemed to fully return to its previous glory pre-Covid, as it featured 5 haunted houses and 3 scare zones, as opposed to the paltry 3 and 2 respectively last year. On top of that, 2 of the haunted houses were themed by prominent IPs (The Weeknd and Netflix's All Of Us Are Dead). That definitely drove hype even further.

Consequently, the major con was the seemingly larger crowd this time; I'll get to this at the end...

As photography and videography were not allowed at any of the attractions, we mostly just took pictures of the entrance of each haunted house/scare zone. [This sneak peek by Dejiki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2o-BlwXoJg) is an excellent summary of our night though.

# Haunted houses

For most of the night, the waiting time for ***each*** haunted house was insane, the shortest being 30 minutes even at around 12 AM. With the massive crowds, it was also rare for us to be able to walk through a house (save for maybe 1 or 2) without being spoiled at each section by a group of people not far in front of us. That being said, I was still able to appreciate the props, decoration and scare actors, all of which/whom were honestly well-executed.

## Netflix's All Of Us Are Dead

Our first stop after veering off from the main initial crowd, which ironically looked like a zombie horde, was the haunted house featuring 1 of this event's prominent IPs.

We had been lured into the queue with the promise of a 25 minute wait, but we ended up queuing for... **90 minutes**.

*We took more pictures here than for any other attraction because our energy levels were still pretty high :)*

I honestly felt like I could have appreciated this haunted house way more if I had watched the show beforehand, but I was definitely still able to enjoy what I assumed were faithful but compact recreations of the different scenes. Ultimately though, the theme of a zombie outbreak at a school just didn't seem as scary as the themes in the other houses.

## The Weeknd: After Hours Til Dawn Nightmare

I had watched a video showcasing Universal Studio's Hollywood version of this haunted house last year and had done a full run-through of the album itself a couple of times, so I was pretty excited to experience this first-hand. *After the customary long-ish wait to get in, of course.*

Because this was a familiar theme to me, I thought the presentation of this attraction was by far the best of the night. The creepy maze featured in last year's Superbowl half-time show was there and it felt pretty trippy to go through it with Megan. The actors' make-up was quite life-like too; I legitimately thought some of the actors looked exactly like the old version of the singer himself. But similar to the first haunted house, I just didn't think the attraction itself was that scary.

## Grimm Encounters

![grimm-1](/images/posts/things/halloween-horror-nights-11/grimm-1.jpeg)

In the next haunted house, we found ourselves in a horror-like reimagining of various fantasy worlds with their grotesque, new habitants. This was the first of 3 Singapore-original houses, and it was the only one with seemingly more Western-influenced themes, as opposed to the Asian ones for the last 2.

![grimm-2](/images/posts/things/halloween-horror-nights-11/grimm-2.JPG)

We finally got to be the first ones in the mini-group that went into the house, and it was definitely way more fun than if we weren't. I remembered seeing goblins, witches and goblin witches in a sinister overgrowth kind of backdrop. Most of the rooms felt way darker in atmosphere compared to the ones in the first 2 haunted houses. And oh my, the last section of this house was probably in my top 3 moments of the night.

## DIYU: Descent into Hell

The queue times were starting to get shorter, but we suspected it was because the staff were releasing more people in each group into the haunted house and were doing so at a faster rate as well. We were lucky enough to be in front again this time though :)

![diyu](/images/posts/things/halloween-horror-nights-11/diyu.JPG)

The theme for this haunted house was Hell as depicted in Chinese mythology. This one definitely had the most red, and a lot of the props were disgustingly and freakishly realistic. It was glorious.

## Rebirth of the Matriarch

While queuing for the Weeknd house, I honestly thought we weren't going to be able to experience all the haunted houses. At this point though, the wait times were as "short" as 30 minutes so we managed to thankfully clutch it out.

![matriach](/images/posts/things/halloween-horror-nights-11/matriach.jpeg)

This last haunted house was supposed to be a labyrinth-like structure of a haunted Peranakan house. The interiors were so well done, it honestly did feel like a cursed version of those traditional houses you would see around Singapore. I thought this one wasn't as scary as the other 2 original IP houses, but it did have its unique charm.

# Scare zones

Also scattered throughout the theme park were 3 scare zones, which also had their own theme each.

## The Hacker

This area, situated in the *New York* region, felt mostly like a connector between the entrance of the park and the *Sci-Fi City* region. Its theme was by far the least creepy this year, and it didn't help that there was no dedicated "walking path" like the other 2 scare zones did. Kudos for trying something different though.

**Horror**: 1/5

## The Cursed Kiramam

The area this was in gave Megan and I PTSD because last year, it had a bunch of the actors literally chasing us and giving us the best scares then. This kind of scare zone felt better than the haunted houses in some ways, as it maintained the maze-like structure of a haunted house but had a more open feel to it, giving the actors more freedom to induce terror in us.

![kiramam](/images/posts/things/halloween-horror-nights-11/kiramam.JPG)

Here, we found ourselves in a sort of evil-infused jungle, and the open-nature of the scare zone made the darkness feel natural and more realistic.

By the way, if you are coming for Halloween Horror Nights this year, do NOT miss out on this scare zone (*Dead Man's Wharf* as well). They're just as good as the haunted houses and you don't have to wait in line to experience them.

## Dead Manâ€™s Wharf

![wharf](/images/posts/things/halloween-horror-nights-11/wharf.jpeg)

The last attraction we visited was strategically situated by the water, and its theme was aptly a wharf filled with the creepiest pirates one can imagine. This place made us very wary of turning corners, as almost every turn had a scare actor waiting to jump us. A few of them got Megan pretty good :)

# My thoughts

I thought this year was better than last year in some ways, but worse in others.

The bigger crowd detracted from the overall experience quite a bit. Maybe it was the fact that there were more haunted houses, but it did feel like we had to wait longer than we did last year. I definitely would consider paying a little bit extra to get express tickets and not have to wait nearly as long. Also, while I know it definitely wasn't feasible, it would've been great if we could experience the haunted houses without random strangers.

As far as the experiences at the attractions themselves went though, the scares this year felt really unique, as some of the jumps included things like giant monsters, and multiple actors coming at you from multiple angles. The storylines of this year's haunted houses and scare zones were all really coherent and well put together. The fact that we had the usual 5 houses this time meant that we had a greater bang for our buck, albeit at the expense of being more tired in the end.

I ultimately enjoyed myself in this year's Halloween Horror Nights and am looking forward to going again next year, hopefully with express tickets...
