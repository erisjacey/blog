It was a great day to be out *attempting to* ski again. I had finally gained confidence to snowplough yesterday, and even tried a little of [parallel skiing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPHxQ6_AWCY). Today's goal was to practise the latter more while finally being able to venture beyond the beginner slopes.

# Breakfast: Hotel

My health and appetite for the most part returned, so I decided to regain my lost nutrients and have a big breakfast. I just loved the complimentary spread at this hotel. The variety changed slightly each day, the macros seemed very friendly, and it just seemed like the perfect style of breakfast for a full day of skiing.

# Exploring Shiga Kogen

One thing I forgot to mention in yesterday's blog was the extreme convenience of the entry point to the slopes a few minutes from our hotel by foot, which I think was much needed due to how uncomfortable it felt to walk in skiing boots. Due to my very limited skill, however, Megan and I were basically confined to the beginner slopes there.

*We mostly skied in the Ichinose Family Ski Area.*

I was determined to get out of the beginner area and at least tackle a couple of longer slopes with Megan. After practising a couple of runs of the two shorter beginner slopes that began one after the other, we both were confident enough to take the ski lift that took us all the way to the start of the black (expert) slope.

Of course, we weren't going to actually go down the black slope. There was another beginner slope that was much longer and would land us back where we had started in a more roundabout and scenic way.

However, we painfully found out that the start of the slope actually doubled (tripled?) as a transitionary point to get to another ski area.

*I simply can't get enough of vistas like these though!*

The accidental trip to the *Terakoya Ski Area* felt particularly laboured as I hadn't yet figured out how to properly move on flat ground, nevermind **upslope**. Nevertheless, when we finally got there, we did some improvised route planning and... took the ski lift back down. The slopes were at least of intermediate level.

*Technically still went down an intermediate slope, just not directly. :)*

# Lunch

The whole "getting lost" debacle took some time and energy so lunch was just about in order. We again used our meal tickets and got some nice pasta and omu rice, along with a cup of hot chocolate each. I swear, the choices offered seemed perfect for a day in the mountains, hitting the slopes.

# Scuffed parallel skiing

With a better idea of how to read signs, we went back to the start of the black slope and continued to where the start of the long green (beginner) slope actually was. Doing this run was probably the highlight of this part of our trip. While I still had to pay **some** attention to not falling, I was finally able to mostly immerse myself in the thrill of skiing. I was enjoying the juxtaposition of the thrill of zooming downhill, along with marveling at the scenery in my peripheral past the cliffside. It was pure bliss.

With moderate aplomb, I even attempted to take a video of myself and my surroundings while skiing. It did backfire as I dropped my phone and stumbled, so that was humbling. The rest of the time, I decided to stay modest and focus on practising my parallel skiing.

In the end, I would say my left turns felt comfortable, but my right turns still felt pretty awkward. So the furthest I got was this scuffed style of left-turning parallelly, but doing a snowplough when turning to my right. While definitely ugly, it seemed to work pretty well. At least I know the first thing I would need to work on in the next ski trip.

Megan and I enjoyed a couple more runs down the same scenic slope before the ski lifts were going to close again. It was time to say goodbye to skiing for this trip...

# Dinner: Hotel

It was back to my most favourite activity after niche and frankly expensive sports: eating. We enjoyed our last dinner in Shiga Kogen with another unsurprisingly glorious spread.

Again, there wasn't much to do afterwards, and we needed to pack up for by far our longest travel day tomorrow, so we did that and then rested for the night.

# My thoughts

I should have been more aware of my tendencies to be a slow learner, as I found myself having to work really hard to figuratively, *and literally*, get off the ground. That being said, today was definitely a lot more "successful" than yesterday. And in hindsight, all the stumbling made all the not-doing-so even more satisfying. What's even better was the realisation that this gratification would only continue to grow with each successive ski trip, as I hopefully continue to improve. There's so much more to work on and try out, and there are so many more mountains on which for me to go down.

But that's for next time. There's still more in Japan for us to experience!
