After a short detour at the lovely village of Shirakawago, we proceeded to take a 1-hour bus to the city of [Kanazawa](https://visitkanazawa.jp/en/). The city is notably known for [*Kenrokuen Garden*](https://visitkanazawa.jp/en/attractions/detail_10106.html), supposedly one of Japan's three most beautiful gardens. I was excited to visit it. On top of that, while Takayama boasts soft high-graded beef, Kanazawa, being a coastal area, is famous for the batches of fresh seafood brought in on the daily from nearby seaside ports.

It therefore wasn't surprising that our first stop upon arriving was to try some seafood. We were already immediately able to feel more of a city vibe here, as there were a couple tall buildings in the city centre where Kanazawa Station was, and among them was a [mall](https://www.kanazawastation.com/kanazawa-forus-shopping-mall/).

An annoying consequence of the more accessible city was also the horde of people all around, so a lot of restaurants in the mall had queues of people outside of them. Thankfully, we didn't have to wait too long for our [restaurant of choice](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298115-d10311406-Reviews-Shiroku_Kanazawa_Forus-Kanazawa_Ishikawa_Prefecture_Hokuriku_Chubu.html) for today's lunch.

# Lunch: Shiroku

This restaurant, like all the other ones in this mall, had more of a chain-y feel to it. But my hopeful self had the impression that since it specialised in [chirashi don](https://savorjapan.com/contents/discover-oishii-japan/chirashi-sushi-or-kaisen-don-not-even-japanese-people-know-all-the-differences/), it was still gonna use the fresh local seafood for its ingredients.

In any case, Megan and I both got different chirashi don, each with an assortment of seafood on it. I made sure to get some uni while Megan made sure to... not. She did get an extra bowl of soba noodles because why not.

All in all, I thought the rice bowl was tasty. Again, I'm not sure if it's because of my pre-conceived notions of this area's food specialty, or because we had so much beef the past few days, but the seafood felt like a breath of fresh air. After initially combining all the ingredients with the rice, each bite was a delicious harmonious blend of umami. I distinctly remember especially enjoying the shrimp sashimi; Japan really knows how to serve the sweetest shrimp.

It was from this lunch onwards that I kinda stopped religiously taking note of the menu and the prices of each individual dish, but our total bill amounted to Â¥3960.

# Yasue Gold Leaf Museum

We tried to exercise our lunch away by spending the few hours left in the afternoon checking out some of the tourist attractions 30 min away by foot. During our short and peaceful walk, I noticed more and more that while Kanazawa still wasn't a bustling city like Tokyo, it still had a different kind of charm compared to walking past the seemingly more traditional buildings in Takayama. The area felt more spacious and its coastal nature gave way to a breeze once in a while.

We reached our first attraction, the [*Kanazawa Yasue Gold Leaf Museum*](https://www.kanazawa-museum.jp/kinpaku/english/). In Japan, Kanazawa is the biggest producer of gold leaf, which has been historically used mainly for decoration, for stuff ranging from temples to craft works and even food. The museum was supposed to showcase the history of gold leaf in the region.

...But it was closed on this day. We knew it was not going to be open on New Year's Day, but we honestly weren't that interested, so no big loss. It was just along the way to another major attraction, so we decided to drop by momentarily.

# Higashi Chaya District

Not far from the museum was [one of Kanazawa's largest geisha districts](https://visitkanazawa.jp/en/attractions/detail_10212.html).
