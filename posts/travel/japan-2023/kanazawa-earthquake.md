After a short detour at the lovely village of Shirakawago, we proceeded to take a 1-hour bus to the city of [Kanazawa](https://visitkanazawa.jp/en/). The city is notably known for [*Kenrokuen Garden*](https://visitkanazawa.jp/en/attractions/detail_10106.html), supposedly one of Japan's three most beautiful gardens. I was excited to visit it. On top of that, while Takayama boasts soft high-graded beef, Kanazawa, situated near the coast, is famous for the batches of fresh seafood brought in on the daily from nearby seaside ports.

It therefore wasn't surprising that our first stop upon arriving was to try some seafood. We were already immediately able to feel more of a city vibe here, as there were a couple of tall buildings in the city centre where Kanazawa Station was, and among them was a [mall](https://www.kanazawastation.com/kanazawa-forus-shopping-mall/).

An annoying consequence of the more accessible city was also the horde of people all around, so a lot of restaurants in the mall had queues of people outside of them. Thankfully, we didn't have to wait too long for our [restaurant of choice](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298115-d10311406-Reviews-Shiroku_Kanazawa_Forus-Kanazawa_Ishikawa_Prefecture_Hokuriku_Chubu.html) for today's lunch.

# Lunch: Shiroku

This restaurant, like all the other ones in this mall, had more of a chain-y feel to it. But my hopeful self had the impression that since it specialised in [chirashi don](https://savorjapan.com/contents/discover-oishii-japan/chirashi-sushi-or-kaisen-don-not-even-japanese-people-know-all-the-differences/), it was still gonna use the fresh local seafood for its ingredients.

In any case, Megan and I both got different chirashi don, each with an assortment of seafood on it. I made sure to get some uni while Megan made sure to... not. She did get an extra bowl of soba noodles because why not.

All in all, I thought the rice bowl was tasty. Again, I'm not sure if it's because of my pre-conceived notions of this area's food specialty, or because we had had so much beef the past few days, but the seafood felt like a breath of fresh air. After initially combining all the ingredients with the rice, each bite was a delicious harmonious blend of umami. I distinctly remember especially enjoying the shrimp sashimi; Japan really knows how to serve the sweetest shrimp.

It was from this lunch onwards that I kinda stopped religiously taking note of the menu and the prices of each individual dish, but our total bill amounted to ¥3960.

# Yasue Gold Leaf Museum

We tried to exercise our lunch away by spending the few hours left in the afternoon checking out some of the tourist attractions 30 min away by foot. During our short and peaceful walk, I noticed more and more that while Kanazawa still wasn't a bustling city like Tokyo, it still had a different kind of charm compared to walking past the seemingly more traditional buildings in Takayama. The area felt more spacious and its coastal nature gave way to a breeze once in a while.

We reached our first attraction, the [*Kanazawa Yasue Gold Leaf Museum*](https://www.kanazawa-museum.jp/kinpaku/english/). In Japan, Kanazawa is the biggest producer of gold leaf, which has been historically used mainly for decoration, for stuff ranging from temples to craft works and even food. The museum was supposed to showcase the history of gold leaf in the region.

...But it was closed on this day. We knew it was not going to be open on New Year's Day, but we honestly weren't that interested, so no big loss. It was just along the way to another major attraction, so we decided to drop by momentarily.

# Higashi Chaya District

Not far from the museum was [one of Kanazawa's largest geisha districts](https://visitkanazawa.jp/en/attractions/detail_10212.html). Parts of the city were historically known to house specific groups of people, and have been preserved to this day. There were samurai districts, merchant houses, and areas for geisha. Of the latter, probably the most famous and thus most touristy is *Higashi Chaya*.

We saw quite a number buildings which have been refurbished into shops and restaurants, so we decided to spend some time in a few of them. In particular, we came across this three-storey shop which had nothing but gold leaf products. We realised the patented gold leaf ice cream was being sold by basically every other shop, so we finally bit the bullet and decided to try one together.

![gold-leaf-ice-cream](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/kanazawa-earthquake/gold-leaf-ice-cream.JPG)

Upon initial purchase, it was essentially just a regular vanilla ice cream. Some guy then slapped a thin sheet of gold leaf on just one side. So then it became just a regular vanilla ice cream with a flavourless shiny decoration on one side. Priced at ¥900.

While definitely overpriced, the novelty was pretty fun for a while. And the ice cream itself was still pretty good. As we were finishing our snack, though, we experienced something neither of us saw showing up on our itinerary...

# 2024 Noto Earthquake

The ground started shaking pretty violently, and while everyone (including us) in the shop was scampering to head outside and figure out what was going on, an eerie alert from the Japan Meteorological Agency synchronously reverberated from everyone's phones.

It was an earthquake.

After what seemed like an eternity of shaking, I honestly thought that was gonna be it. And then suddenly... There was another creepy alert.

This time, it was warning us of an incoming **major** tsunami.

We were advised to seek high ground. I looked around, and saw that the tallest building surrounding us was only a few storeys tall. This was when we decided to screw it and just try to make it back to our hotel as fast as we could.

The 1.6km run back was pretty much the only intense exercise we did the entire trip. It was a terrible condition for us to run in. Megan was wearing her boots, and I was just simply out of shape. We each had to take multiple stops throughout what essentially was a HIIT session for our lives. Okay exaggerating, but still. Not fun.

On the way, we tried to converse with a couple of Japanese locals with the help of Google Translate, asking them things like if 30 minutes was still enough to escape an incoming tsunami. They ultimately weren't the most helpful, but it wasn't really surprising considering the language barrier and the fact that we were all still confused by what had happened.

During our scramble back, we could also see that some shops were especially ravaged by the quake. In particular, I saw a small emptied bar that had broken bottles and half eaten food strewn all over the floor.

We finally reached our hotel covered in sweat. What happened the next few hours was pretty much just us sitting in the upper lobby floor with the other worried folks. Every so often, we would see a couple of hotel staff checking in on us and updating us with the current situation. The occasional aftershock would also show up. They weren't as devastating as the initial quake but they were strong enough to keep you on your toes.

At about 7:30 PM, 3 hours after the earthquake, we were told the situation had been stabilised and that we were allowed to head back to our rooms. It was surreal overhearing some of the seemingly stranded people taking shelter in the lobby pleading for a room. The staff had to turn them down...

*A snippet of some of the damage the quake caused to the hotel.*

After some time, one of the staff members called us and told us they would be providing some food in the lobby as a sort of relief. It was a simple spread of various plain pastries, along with some miso soup. When we headed down, we saw a lot of people, including whole families, just settled on whatever space they could find on the floor.

This cemented my amazement at the hotel staff in how they were really prompt in their response to the earthquake. They were extremely professional throughout this ordeal, even though I'm sure they had concerns of their own regarding what had happened. I am still very grateful for their hospitality especially in such circumstances.

We ended up having to cancel most of our plans in Kanazawa the day after, and just hoped that we would be able to leave for our next destination in two days.

# My thoughts

I had never directly experienced a natural disaster before, so I was honestly terrified during the whole thing, especially when we were warned of a major tsunami. While Megan and my situation was definitely not the most disastrous, it made me realise how damaging such catastrophes can be. 

And I know countless others had it worse. My heart goes out to everyone affected by the earthquake and resulting tsunami, especially those nearer to the epicenter.
