Before going to our next place, we decided to have some dessert in the main Sannomachi area. We sadly found that all the dessert places either didn't review very well on Google, or were filled with so many people it didn't seem like it was worth the wait. Thankfully, we stumbled on a place selling Hida beef skewers, and we thought they'd be interesting.

Not a dessert, I know, but this snack reminded us once again that you really can't go wrong with anything with the label "Hida beef" on it. Soft and juicy.

# Higashiyama Walking Course

After an enjoyable nibble, we headed to the start of the [*Higashiyama Walking Course*](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5906.html). It is a walking route through Takayama's temple area, essentially taking us to the more quiet part of the town. We were promised sights of more than a dozen common temples and shrines, the ruins of Takayama's former castle, as well as a vista or two of a rural village.

At regular intervals of the 3.5km long route, we'd see signposts like the one above giving us directions. While the route was fairly straightforward, my terrible navigational skills meant that we definitely would've gotten lost if not for these signposts.

The start of this course featured a lot of the temples and shrines we'd been told about, but the views slowly transitioned to scenes of the rural houses of Takayama. Megan and I personally welcomed this change, as it was really interesting to pass by a few of the locals going about their afternoon, in what I could only assume was a calmer way of life to that in the bustling Tokyo (or Singapore) city. 

At this point, I should probably point out that for some reason, I was totally enamoured with the fact that basically every building in Takayama was no more than a few storeys tall. The only "tall" buildings were probably only the few hotels closer to the city center, and even then they were maybe 10 storeys-tall max.

## A pleasant surprise

About an hour into our walk, we randomly came across a locally-run café, and we were already getting hungry, so we decided to give it a try. Immediately upon entering, we were pretty hesitant to take a seat, as we saw a bunch of tourists already seated at the only dining table there. Megan literally had asked me out loud if "we should just leave", but one of the guys already there heard her and told us to just stay. Okay then.

The tourists were kindly shifting around to make way for the two of us when out the corner of my eye, I saw an aged Japanese man, who must've been the owner of the shop, preparing a menu for us. We ordered some drinks, and thought that we were just gonna drink them, and then be on our way.

Along with the drinks, though, he served each of us a tray of various snacks, including some prawn crackers (cute) and a slice of cake, the latter of which I thought was great.

While the coffee I had ordered was nothing to write home about, I should add that it cost just ¥500, so the extra snacks included made the whole thing value-for-money.

On top of all this, we were **once again** reminded of Japanese hospitality. It turned out that the other tourists had been chilling at the café for quite some time now. The owner regularly asked each of us about our ourselves, like where we were from, and if we'd been to Takayama before. He even began entertaining us with his [shamisen](https://www.senzoku-online.jp/TMDL/e/02-shamisen.html), and allowing us to each try it (terribly) too.

He also had us write some words for him on some book of his. I wasn't sure what to write, but the earlier pages had other tourists wishing him a happy new year and good health, so I kinda "took inspiration" from them. 

Finally, he whipped out a really old camera, and for our page in his book, took a picture of Megan and I. It must've taken him about 10 minutes to develop the photo, but as the last surprise of this serendipitous visit, he gave us a copy. Super cool!

We had expected to spend maybe 10 minutes for a quick coffee break, but we ended up staying there for much longer. What a pleasant experience though.

## Into the woods... for a few minutes

We continued our comfortable walk with a full belly and heart, passing by a very peaceful neighborhood. The few locals with whom we would exchange glances were friendly and give us a greeting nod.

![higashiyama-walking-course_farm](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-2/higashiyama-walking-course_farm.JPG)

Most of the "trek" had been flat at this point, but we soon had to start walking up a sloping road to enter the more foresty part of the course. We began our ascent, and while reaching our first landmark not far from the town, we saw a sign warning us of the possible presence of bears. Not fun.

To make things even worse, the sky had already begun to set. For some context, this was shortly after 4 PM, and it's not something we were used to. We also still had a lot of ground to cover if we were going to reach the other end of the woods. It was at this point that we decided it was simply not worth risking having to walk in the woods in the dark, so we turned back and decided to walk along the more well-lit roads instead. We at least got some pictures while we were in the woods, so you can just disregard this paragraph and assume we legitimately completed the walking course.

We were nearing the end of the course, after having effectively truncated the last part, and eventually headed back to the main area once again. We had one more *intoxicating* agenda on our itinerary.

# Funasaka Sake Brewery

[Takayama has been producing sake for more than 300 years](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/153/), and is home to seven breweries, each from which we can sample sake. We ended up choosing [*Funasaka Sake Brewery*](https://www.hida-nombe.jp/funasaka/en.html) for this.

![funasake-sake-brewery_facade](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-2/funasake-sake-brewery_facade.jpg)

In addition to showcasing a good variety of sake bottles for sale, there were about a dozen vending machines that each dispensed a different type of sake. We had to pay ¥100 for a sake cup, and then pay about ¥100 for each token, which can be used at the vending machines to dispense exactly one serving of sake.

![funasake-sake-brewery_vending-machines](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-2/funasake-sake-brewery_vending-machines.jpg)

Each vending machine had detailed information on the type of sake they were offering in both English and Japanese. Megan and I thought 6 cups for the both of us was enough, and I think we were right in that assessment. Some of the sake we had were pretty overwhelming, while some were delicious and really easy to drink, but they were all strong all the same.

I thought it was a fun experience getting to sample sake this way. We also got to keep the sake cup as a mini-souvenir!

# Dinner: Ebihachi

We soon realised we needed to adjust our "body clocks" for meals for the next two weeks as well. It was 5 PM, the sun had fully set and we were getting hungry. It could've also been just the result of a whole day of walking though, I don't know.

Upon a recommendation by one of Megan's friends, we took a short walk to [*Ebihachi*](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g298113-d1498203-Reviews-Ebihachi-Takayama_Gifu_Prefecture_Tokai_Chubu.html), whose specialty was tempura.

![dinner_facade](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-2/dinner_facade.JPG)

We were pretty lucky to have reached the restaurant as soon as it opened, as there was only one available table; the rest had been reserved. I ordered the fish tempura while Megan ordered the shrimp tempura.

As we were served our food, it turned out there was a specific way to eat tempura, at least at this restaurant.

![dinner_instructions](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-2/dinner_instructions.JPG)

I've not had a single bad experience with the food so far in Japan, and this was no exception. The batter used for the tempura was so light and crunchy, and the accompanying condiments served alongside it really complemented the tempura, each in their own unique way.

In addition to the fish/tempura served initially, we were served another fresh vegetable tempura dish every few minutes or so, for a total of six additional pieces. They included a shitake mushroom, shredded onions, eggplant. I can't really remember what the other three were, but they were ALL delicious.

Our total bill ended up amounting to ¥4600.

After a scrumptious dinner and resting at our hotel for a bit, for our last (unplanned) activity of the day, we went back to Sannomachi where the tourist crowd had already left. We soaked in the atmosphere an additional time, because we evidently couldn't get enough of it.

We also managed to snag a photo of Nakabashi Bridge, this time at night and from a better vantage point.

# My thoughts

I really could not have asked for a more perfect first day back in Japan. I always found myself having the most energy and zest at the very beginning of a trip, and I thought it was really fitting to have one of our more activity-filled days right off the bat.

Takayama had so much charm, and I enjoyed the fact that we could take a leisurely stroll to see most of the things the town had to offer. On a side note, being better prepared to be out in the cold this time definitely added to my enjoyment of the winter weather.

My introduction to Hida beef was a very welcome one, and I don't think it's hyperbole to say that it's ruined other versions of beef for me, at least for a while.
