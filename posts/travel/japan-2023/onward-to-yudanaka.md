On this day, we were supposed to head over to our next destination all the way at [*Yudanaka Onsen*](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6024.html), a seemingly quaint hot spring resort in Nagano Prefecture. In the morning, Megan and I still weren't sure if the shinkansen in the area was already operational. Our train didn't leave till about 1 PM, so we decided to head out for a bit to find out the status of the trains, and to visit some of the main attractions of this city while we still could.

# Omicho Market

About 20 min away by foot is [Kanazawa's most famous fish market](https://visitkanazawa.jp/en/attractions/detail_10030.html). We got there pretty early in the morning, so a lot of shops were still closed. The aftermath of the earthquake that had occurred a few days ago probably would cause a considerable number of them to remain closed too.

Anyway, we were still hopeful that we could find our lunch here later, and so we would come back here after visiting the nearby places.

# Kanazawa Castle

[One of Kanazawa's main historic landmarks](https://visitkanazawa.jp/en/attractions/detail_10060.html), the castle boasts some of the usual features a complex of this scale would normally entail in Japan: a storehouse, turret, well-preserved stone walls, and so on.

The walk to the castle saw us walking by a kind-of moat and was quite pleasant, if ever so peaceful due to how few people there were (again, probably thanks to the earthquake). I also felt like of the pathways would have been really nice to take my dog for a walk on.

Unfortunately, there was no way we could verify if the internet was right about what the castle had, because it was understandably closed for post-earthquake monitoring.

*This was as far as we could go. The view was nice enough I guess.*

# Kenrokuen Garden

Possibly the best reason to visit Kanazawa in general would be to see [one of Japan's three most beautiful gardens](https://visitkanazawa.jp/en/attractions/detail_10106.html). Its name apparently means "having six factors", signifying the six garden attributes: spaciousness, tranquility, artifice, antiquity, use of water sources and magnificent views.

I was pining to visit this garden even before landing in Japan, but like the castle, it was closed. :(

![garden](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/onward-to-yudanaka/garden.jpg)

*Another reason to come back to this city in its full glory, I suppose.*

# Lunch

We went back to Omicho Market, starving from our morning walk. Fortunately for us, some of the shops and restaurants had opened, meaning we could try some of Kanazawa's famous seafood right from the market.

We decided to treat ourselves at one of the more lavish-looking restaurants on the second floor. I made the mistake of not keeping track of its name, because the food turned out to be, once again, really really good.

![lunch_sushi](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/onward-to-yudanaka/lunch_sushi.jpg)

I started by ordering for myself a single maguri sushi, which cost a whopping ~¥700. The one-biter was so glorious though, as the tuna was so tender and complemented the well-prepared sushi rice underneath.

![lunch_sashimi](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/onward-to-yudanaka/lunch_sashimi.jpg)

Megan and I also shared a sashimi platter. Its presentation was immaculate, and every piece tasted even more so. My favourite piece was the sweet shrimp; I had had some a few times in this trip alone, but I really could not get over how delicious a piece of shrimp could be. It was just a perfect blend of all-encompassing umami with just a tinge of sweetness.

![lunch_chirashidon](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/onward-to-yudanaka/lunch_chirashidon.jpg)

We lastly each had a seafood don to ourselves. Again, the harmony of the fresh seafood and the rice was pure bliss. Also, I figured this was our last time having sweet shrimp, so I tried my best to savour every single one.

Again, I forgot to record the price of each individual item, but our total amounted to ¥10750. We had expected this, and fully embraced it, especially considering our budget-y meals the day before.

# Leaving Kanazawa, arrival at Yudanaka

We headed back to our hotel to collect our luggage and then to Kanazawa Station. Thankfully, the shinkansen was now up and running. It was time to say goodbye to this region and move closer to a mountainous area once again.

![train_landscape](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/onward-to-yudanaka/train_landscape.jpg)

I enjoyed the views in the train, as we veered further away from the coast and were met with vistas of the mountains. Once we were in Nagano, we took a local train along the Nagano-Dentetsu Line to get to Yudanaka Onsen.

![yudanaka_station](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/onward-to-yudanaka/yudanaka_station.jpg)

In our short walk from the station to our next accommodation, I briefly enjoyed the atmosphere of a quiet village resting among the snowy alps.

![yudanaka_landscape](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/onward-to-yudanaka/yudanaka_landscape.jpg)

We checked into a [ryokan](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2029.html), a type of traditional Japanese inn that differed quite greatly from western-style hotels. It would typically feature tatami-matted rooms, communal baths (onsens), and specially-curated meals whose ingredients are locally sourced. Especially for family-run establishments with just a few rooms, the ambience is usually friendlier as the staff aim to make your stay more personable.

*Our charming room.*

# Dinner: Japanese Dining GOEN

We took our time in settling down, and the sun had already set. We didn't opt for dinner in the ryokan on this night, so we headed to [a restaurant right opposite the station](https://japanese-dining-goen.com/en/). Upon entering, we immediately noticed the place was **filled** with tourists, so we knew it was popular with our demographic.

![dinner_interior](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/onward-to-yudanaka/dinner_interior.jpg)

There was a completely-indoor area as well, but we were seated in the part of the restaurant where we could feel like we were alfresco dining without freezing from the subzero temperatures outside.

![dinner_hot-chocolate](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/onward-to-yudanaka/dinner_hot-chocolate.jpg)

We first each got a cup of hot chocolate. I never knew having one in the winter time could feel this good. It also helped that the drink was delicious on its own.

![dinner_chicken](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/onward-to-yudanaka/dinner_chicken.jpg)

We got some fried chicken, which was fairly crunchy and succulent.

![dinner_ramen](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/onward-to-yudanaka/dinner_ramen.jpg)

The star of the dinner was definitely the chicken ramen. It was shoyu-based, like the ramen we had had during the Takayama portion of the trip, but this time the protein was a few pieces of really tender chicken. Seriously, the chicken was melt-in-your-mouth good. The dish was a very satisfying slurp-fest.

![dinner_omelette](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/onward-to-yudanaka/dinner_omelette.jpg)

To round off our meal, we had an omelette. While this was delicious in its own right, we should not have gotten it, because we were already pretty full from the previous dishes. A mistake in hindsight.

Considering how full we became, and how hearty the meal was, the dinner was well worth the ¥4994 we spent for it.

# Onsen

To cap off the free and easy nature of the day, we decided to take advantage of the in-house onsen. This ryokan featured two communal indoor baths, one for each gender, as well as a private outdoor bath that can be booked in advance for an hour each night per room. 

Stepping into the outdoor bath felt extremely refreshing, and it definitely was more enjoyable than bathing in an indoor hot spring. The main differences were the more pleasant views, and the surrounding cold air, which was now made invigorating with the contrasting hot waters.

# My thoughts

Yudanaka Onsen was a new destination, and once again it had a completely different character from Takayama and Kanazawa. It was by far the most rural of the three, and right off the bat, it seemed like a pretty nice place to visit if you really want to chill by the mountains.

I was mainly looking forward to seeing the snow monkeys the next day.
