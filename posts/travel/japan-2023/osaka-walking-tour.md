country: 'Japan'

Going full circle seemed to be the overarching trend for this trip.

Our trip started from Osaka and was ending in Osaka.

Our travel route from one destination to another was pretty much a perfect circle around central Japan.

And on one of our last days, similar to our very first day in Takayama, we were spending the entire day in the heart of the city we were in, just walking around, enjoying the sights, culture, and of course food.

[Here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1sqHZx0-drIu0ws9DeXDis69R6uXtPKc&usp=sharing) is a link to the route we took.

# Breakfast: Hotel

For the umpteenth time, Megan and I filled our bellies with a nice breakfast, and once gain it was complimentary at the hotel in which we were staying.

The spread looked lavish and felt closer to what a typical hotel spread would look like, contrary to the more homely-style in Shiga Kogen.

# Shinsaibashi-Suji Shopping Street

It was 10 AM, and time for us to head out into [one of the more bustling shopping streets in Osaka](https://osaka-info.jp/en/spot/shinsaibashi-suji-shopping-street/). It was immediately apparent that Osaka seemed to be more of a nightlife city, as the shopping belt was **empty**. There was practically no one else around, and even the shops looked like they were only going to open at lunchtime.

Thankfully, some of the Daiso and equivalent stores opened shortly while we were just walking around, and so we took the opportunity to buy some souvenirs and cheaper facial care products.

During this time, people started swarming in and increasingly more shops began opening. We pretty much had no goal in mind here; we just did a lot of window shopping and little actual shopping at the seemingly endless number of shops. I came close to buying a Burberry scarf, but thankfully decided to save my hundreds of dollars.

# Lunch: Ichiran Ramen

Up to this point, we had somehow managed to go without having a solid bowl of tonkotsu ramen. It was time to correct this sacrilege at arguably [the most popular ramen chain in Japan](https://en.ichiran.com/ramen/) among tourists. The branch nearest to our hotel was only opening at 1 PM (or 2 PM, I forgot), but when we got there at that time, there was already a long queue, and we were told that the waiting time could take up to an hour.

It was an arduous task, but with the help of Yi Long Ma memes, we had finally waited in line long enough to be seated.

I have heard people online call this chain overrated, and claim that there were other superior ramen restaurants in the city, but to me, Ichiran Ramen more than hit the spot. The broth was extremely rich, the texture of the noodles was perfect, and the accompanying spice of the chilli elevated the dish's flavour that much more. All of these were probably thanks to being able to customize our order based on our personal preferences.

Our meal cost ¥3260 in total, which was a fair price considering the extra stuff we had ordered (meat and drinks).

# Dotonbori

After our millionth amazing lunch, we headed back to this cute physical Casetify store. Megan and I decided to buy an iPhone case and MagSafe attachment each, as the prices were cheaper than their online counterparts, and we thought it would be nice to buy some personal remembrances for ourselves.

We then spent a good part of the afternoon in probably [the most well-known tourist area in Osaka](https://osaka-info.jp/en/spot/dotonbori/), which happened to be a stone's throw away from Shinsaibashi. Among the interesting sights, we got to see the Glico running man sign.

Despite us still being full from our ramen lunch, we also shared a cheese-stuffed pancake in the shape of a 10-yen coin. I found the cheese to a bit too solid for my liking, but the batter was pretty good.

Another famous landmark in the area was the giant crab sign towering over the bustling street.

We spent a couple more moments doing a bit of people watching and a lot of people swerving. The latter just drove home the fact that Japan, and Osaka in particular, was really a tourist hotspot.

A small footnote was the fact that we also did a bit of window shopping at [*Bic Camera*](https://www.biccamera.com.e.lj.hp.transer.com/bc/i/shop/shoplist/shop013.jsp). I felt a small wave nostalgia because this was the same place at which I had bought my first "proper" watch several years back.

# Dinner: Gyukatsu Motomura

It was only about 4 PM, but our [restaurant of choice](https://www.gyukatsu-motomura.com/en/) was only a few minutes away from Bic Camera. It had also been increasingly popularised by TikTok, which was how we found out about it as well. Since we knew there was going to be a long line later on, we figured we would beat the crowd and have a really, really early dinner.

![dinner_dishes](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/osaka-walking-tour/dinner_dishes.jpg)

After we had received our food, we could definitely see what the hype was about. The novelty of being responsible for "cooking our own food" was pretty cool, and the food itself was delicious.

That being said, I couldn't help but compare the beef to the Hida cuts we had had earlier in the trip. To me, the latter was far superior. It was way more tender and juicier. The one advantage this beef had was its breaded exterior providing a unique tantalising layer.

![dinner_cooking](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/osaka-walking-tour/dinner_cooking.jpg)

On top of that, we were also way too full to maximise our enjoyment of the meal. Maybe it would have been better in hindsight to come back again later when we were hungrier. 

Gyukatsu Motomura set us back by ¥4530.

# Den Den Town

It was still early in the evening, and so we decided to walk further down the streets into [Den Den Town](https://insideosaka.com/den-den-town-guide/), Osaka's version of [Tokyo's Akihabara](https://www.gotokyo.org/en/spot/55/index.html). This area is supposedly a haven for fans of anime, cameras, electronics and pop culture.

![den-den-town](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/osaka-walking-tour/den-den-town.jpg)

The place felt like it hadn't changed from what I last was there. There was a variety of goods being sold, ranging from anime figurines and video games, all the way to ***interesting*** merchandise, which I'll just say was not the most child-friendly. 

# Kuromon Market

After satisfying our curiosities by perusing some of the more *peculiar* stores, we thought it was getting a bit late, and that maybe it was a good idea to head back to our hotel to rest early for the night. We began our journey back, and at about the halfway mark, happened upon another [pretty popular fish market](https://kuromon.com/en/). It was already closed by then, so we just took a picture of it and went on our merry way.

# My thoughts

It was fun to once again just walk around the heart of a city and indulge its own most famous and albeit touristy experiences. I'm glad we took advantage of where we were staying and visited pretty much all of the "must-gos" in the Namba area. The walking tour was satisfying and made me even more excited for our last day in Japan, which would see us in one of the country's best theme parks.
