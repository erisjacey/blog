# A hesitant start

Today was a day of uncertainty. With most of the city's shops and establishments closed after yesterday's earthquake, our day's agenda was as shaky as the aftershocks. Nature and the city's recovery efforts seemed to be the only ones holding the reins.

# Trip to Lawson: a necessary errand

In need of sustenance, we made a trip to Lawson. The usually bustling convenience store was a shadow of its usual self, with most of the aisles cleared out and the remaining supplies depleting rapidly. But we managed to scrape together enough for a meal - a testament to the variety of Japanese konbini food.

# Netflix and ch*ll: the sequel

With the city at a standstill and our outdoor plans dashed, we turned to our trusty friend, Netflix. We ended up watching a mixed bag of shows, from the satirical _Don't Look Up_ to a documentary that cleverly promoted veganism under the guise of a scientific exploration of diets on twins. It was an entertaining way to pass the time, given the circumstances.

# A brief stroll around the station

We decided to stretch our legs with a short walk around the station. It was a quiet stroll, with the station's usual hustle replaced by a serene calm. The sight of the halted train service was a stark reminder of the earthquake's impact. We could only hope that we would be able to leave for our next destination the next day.

# Dinner: a Lawson smorgasbord
 
For dinner, we dug into the spoils of our Lawson expedition. It was a simple meal, but somehow, it felt special. According to Megan, it was one of the best, if not the best, dinners we had had. Perhaps it was the circumstances, or maybe Lawson food is just that good.

# My thoughts

As we followed the news about the earthquake, we couldn't help but think about those in worse situations. Our inability to fully explore Kanazawa suddenly seemed trivial. The tsunami warning had thankfully been reduced to a minor level, but the thought of the disaster still hung heavily in the air. Today was a reminder of nature's power and the resilience of people in the face of adversity.
