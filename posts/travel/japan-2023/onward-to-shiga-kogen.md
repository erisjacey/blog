It was time to head to what I had been looking forward to most in the trip. For me personally, I tried skiing exactly a year ago and found it to be one of the most enjoyable things to do in a winter trip, probably because of a combination of the thrill and the spectacle of speeding down snow-capped winter landscapes.

[*Shiga Kogen Mountain Resort*](https://shigakogen-ski.or.jp/english/) is the largest combined ski area in Japan, boasting a group of 18 ski resorts joined together. It consists of several areas, which alone could already take a whole day to explore. We had strategically planned this as our next destination as it was only 30 min away from Yudanaka Station by bus.

# Breakfast: Ryokan

We got to enjoy our last meal at the ryokan with another sumptuous breakfast. Unfortunately, Megan had feeling pretty unwell as our ryokan admittedly did not have adequate heating to combat the biting cold, so I went for breakfast by myself. I ended up (read: attempted) eating both our portions as I didn't want to waste food, so to say I was satisfied was very much an overstatement.

# Bus to Shiga Kogen

As mentioned, the bus to the ski resorts was fairly straightforward, and before lunch, we were already in the mountains. Before we reached our stop, we had already seen a bunch of slopes that (spoiler alert!) we would not be able to visit the rest of our time here. It was pretty cool to see just how big Shiga Kogen was though.

# Lunch

Megan and I decided to get some lunch before considering our next plans. While waiting to be able to check into our hotel, we ordered some food at the premise itself. It was a pretty simple fare, wherein we could order through a vending machine.

# Chilling

At this point, Megan's health had not gotten better, so we agreed to spend the rest of the day recovering and taking shelter from the subzero temperatures outside. The TV didn't seem to work very well, so I just took the opportunity to check out a bunch of skiing tutorials, because as much as I mentioned I had enjoyed the activity, I was really bad and still inexperienced at it.

# Dinner: Traveler's Bar Shigakogen Tacos Z

Not long after, it was already dinnertime, so we braved into the dark and cold for a few minutes to get to our choice of restaurant: a place serving Mexican food. We thought it would be a good break from all the all-too-healthy Japanese food we had been having.

It turned out to indeed be the case, as I realise my unhealthy self did need some fried food once in a while. To go even further, we each had a glass of beer. Personally, I thought their locally-brewed beer was terrible and would not want to have it again.

# My thoughts

This day was mostly a transitionary phase, and while we were not able to go skiing, it was probably a good thing we had reserved three full days here.
