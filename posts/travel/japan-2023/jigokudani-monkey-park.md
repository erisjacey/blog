On this day, the only item on our itinerary was the [*Jigokudani Monkey Park*](https://en.jigokudani-yaenkoen.co.jp/). This place is considered a must-visit in Japan, and it was one of the two main reasons we decided to stay in Yamanouchi for a couple of days. Its main draw are the wild Japanese macaque, also known as snow monkeys, which regularly bathe in the hot springs constructed by the locals just for them. I thought it would be pretty cool to see them soaking in the hot springs in the biting frost, just like humans do.

# Breakfast: Ryokan

Before heading off to the park, we were treated to a fabulous breakfast in the ryokan at which we were staying, served [*kaiseki*](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/guide-to-kaiseki-cuisine/index.html)-style. Every single dish, from the mackerel to the vegetables, felt really fresh and had a flavour that seemed homely. The shabu-shabu, in particular, was remarkably delicious, as we cooked it in a hearty soy broth.

# Jigokudani Monkey Park

After a substantial breakfast, we took a short bus trip to the entrance of the park, where we were met with a light snow. I reveled in it; it was a type of weather I could only see when going on winter trips, so for me it felt way nicer than rain in the tropics, for instance.

To get to the hot springs and the monkeys, we needed to do a ~2km (or ~30 min) mini-hike, on a mostly flat route. The walk was really scenic, and the snow that continued to powder our path made for quite a nice backdrop. However, the double-edged sword was that the snow would melt on the ground, mix with the soil, and form mud, which made the route dirty and slippery.

We eventually reached the end of the hike, and encountered a small set of houses that seemed like a quaint place in which to live.

Our last "hurdle" was another entrance booth, wherein we had to pay the admission fee to the park (¥800). A small price to pay for what seemed like a worthy endeavour.

As soon as we entered the park, we already got to see several snow monkeys just roaming around. There were a few that were walking pretty close to us tourists, and they naturally ended up being the subjects of many photographs.

We got to the hot springs area, which admittedly wasn't as big I had expected. It didn't help that in a sort-of expectation-vs-reality fashion, there were just so many people crowded around the hot springs.

Still, we got to observe the monkeys bathing and seemingly really enjoying it. Another uncanny thing I saw was how some of them were cleaning one another; it felt human-like as well.

After soaking in the unique views and atmosphere, it was starting to get cold, so we warmed up in the entrance booth, which doubled as a shelter. We began our descent to the park entrance the same way we went up, staying wary once again about the slippery and muddy path.

# Lunch: Enza Café

It was around 2 PM when we got back down, so we were pretty hungry. We decided to eat at [the only restaurant option in the area](https://enzacafe.com/en/). For a fairly action-packed morning and early afternoon, we decided to treat ourselves each to a hearty bowl of chicken ramen and hot drink, along with a bowl of french fries to share. I have completely run out of unique words to describe the food that we'd have, so I'll just say it was all delicious as usual and move on.

That said, we probably shouldn't have ordered that much, as dinner was only a few hours away, and we knew it was going to be insane portion-wise, judging from how breakfast went.

Our bill amounted to ¥4515.

After heading back to our ryokan, we decided to give ourselves a break from the cold and spend the rest of the afternoon resting, in order to prepare for last challenge of the day: finishing our dinner.

# Dinner: Ryokan

Much like breakfast, our dinner was a kaiseki meal served in the ryokan. Our host served us multiple courses, which again tasted like it was made literal moments ago, and with a certain "craftsmanship" to them. The most interesting was the assorted tempura, which included a few deep-fried apple slices. While I'm still not fully decided on how I feel about it, I found the combination of the sweet tang of the apple with the light and crunchy batter exterior to be intriguing to say the least.

We were really full in the end and regrettably could not finish all our food. I thought it was a pretty good dinner, though, all things considered.

We ended our evening with another visit to the in-house onsen and decided to turn in for the night afterwards.

# My thoughts

The snow monkey park was definitely feature some of the more interesting sights I've had in this trip so far, and outside the hot springs area, I was still enjoying the quaint feel of the onsen town of Yudanaka. I am glad to have crossed this place off my ever-growing bucket list, and have delighted in some ryokan-style hospitality while I was at it.
