*This post covers our activities for the day until lunch.*

On the very first full day of our trip in Japan, we found ourselves in the heart of Takayama, a city located in Gifu Prefecture. Most of the things to see and do in the city itself are actually located within walking distance from one another, so Megan and I thought it might be a good idea to start the trip with a free and easy walking tour, instead of having to worry about extra logistics needed for a day trip or whatever.

*Easy* might not have been the best word to use in retrospect, though, as we actually ended up covering quite a bit of ground to see as much as we could in this charming city.

[Here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1Uns9fCKn4TcdA2Spl7o_yMkB3G1wego&usp=sharing) is a link to the route we took.

# Takayama Jinya

The first in our long list of places to visit is [an old government office building](https://jinya.gifu.jp/en/), whose origins date back to the Edo period (17th century). It now functions as a museum that features well-maintained tatami rooms which used to have different functions, but now are display rooms that showcase historical artifacts and documents of the past.

...That's what Google says it is. We unforunately never got to find out for ourselves because the place was closed. A sad coincidence of visting this area during the new year period of 28 December to 3 January, but luckily this was one of the only places that was closed on this day.

# Jinya-mae Morning Markets

Literally a stone's throw away was the first of two [morning markets](https://www.hida.jp/english/touristattractions/takayamacity/historyandculture/4000162.html) the area is home to. This one seemed to be catered more towards locals, and wasn't very big. We were pretty disappointed, because while quaint, the stalls didn't have much in the way of food, and at least I was getting hungry. It was still pretty fun to see the wares and raw goods being offered though.

# Nakabashi

Getting to the main touristy area of the city required us to the cross what is possibly one of the more famous sights in the area, [a bridge that crosses the Miyagawa River featuring traditional style crimson handrails](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-4100139/).

![nakabashi-1](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/nakabashi-1.JPG)

Overlooking the bridge is a tranquil sight of houses lined up by the river, and this was a pleasantly different sight for someone who's used to seeing tall buildings with (in my opinion) way less charm.

# Sanmachi Suji: Takayama Old Town

We finally reached the place most tourists would probably read about first when they Google Takayama. This area is [a group of three historically-preserved districts](http://japantraveladvice.com/sanmachi-suji/), which is filled with traditional houses that feel very aesthetically unique. Simply taking a stroll along these streets made us feel like we were taken back to the Edo period, especially before the waves of tourists came flooding in the later parts of the morning.

Megan and I found ourselves coming back to this area a few more times in the day (and night!), mostly because many of the shops were still closed this early, but also to simply soak in the atmosphere, which I realise now really was quite unrivalled to anywhere else.

*This picture was taken on Sannomachi Street, probably the most famous street of the three.*

# Miyagawa Morning Markets

We arrived at the market that was more catered towards tourists, and we were so glad to find shops selling food, as we still had not eaten anything at this point. We took a pleasant walk in the market, which was very nicely situated along the river, making sure to try any food that looked interesting, as well as take our time perusing the various trinkets on sale.

![miyagawa-morning-market](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/miyagawa-morning-market.JPG)

Takayama is home to [Hida beef](https://dining.japan.travel/en/article/o_07/index.html), which is supposed to rival the famous Kobe beef in terms of quality and taste. We ended up seeing a lot of restaurants specialising in Hida beef, and I guess it was pretty symbolic (or strategic on their end) that the first food stall we chanced upon sold nothing but *Hida beef sushi*.

![market-food_beef-sushi-1](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/market-food_beef-sushi-1.JPG)

We could definitely tell the locals here cared about their craft, and this stall was no exception. The lady making and selling the sushi would prepare each piece by hand only upon ordering. This meant that each order would take much longer to complete, but it definitely gave us the confidence that the food would be fresh, and let me just say...

I don't think I've ever had beef this soft and tasty, and at less than $10. The beef had so much umami flavour, and its texture was so soft it was practically melting in my mouth. The one-biter I took left me so satisfied, but even hungrier for more at the same time.

![market-food_beef-sushi-2](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/market-food_beef-sushi-2.JPG)

We next came across a *takoyaki* stall, and while the place wasn't known for it, we thought why not.

![market-food_takoyaki-1](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/market-food_takoyaki-1.JPG)

Not even talking about the food, but it was from this stall onwards that I was reminded of how hospitable Japanese people were. In this case, it really made for an excellent combination with how delicious the takoyaki was, as its fresh warmth contrasted the cold nicely. As someone who always has reservations about how chewy octopus can be, this one was really soft.

![market-food_takoyaki-2](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/market-food_takoyaki-2.JPG)

We also tried some *mitarashi dango*, which traditionally are sweet soy sauce glazed rice dumplings. However, in Takayama, [mitarashi dango is served as a savoury snack](https://www.thehiddenthimble.com/six-must-try-local-foods-in-takayama/). The dumplings are instead glazed with a savoury soy sauce and grilled over a hot fire.

We ordered two sticks, one with just the glaze, and another with kinako (roasted soybean flour) sprinkled on it.

![market-food_mitarashi-dango-1](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/market-food_mitarashi-dango-1.JPG)

I'd personally not had any version of dango prior to this, but I thoroughly enjoyed the savoury char of the dumplings, coupled with the interesting texture profile, which featured a thin crunchy charred exterior that wrapped around a slightly chewy mochi interior.

The kinako version added yet another layer of complexity, re-introducing a sweet profile to the snack in an interesting and delicious way.

![market-food_mitarashi-dango-2](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/market-food_mitarashi-dango-2.JPG)

Our final patronage at the market had us trying some *tamaten*, another snack we had never seen before. Apparently, it is [a dessert made from eggs, sugar and agar](https://allabout-japan.com/en/article/1717/#:~:text=Owara%20Tamaten%20is%20the%20signature,and%20taste%20like%20toasted%20marshmallows.).

![market-food_tamaten-1](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/market-food_tamaten-1.JPG)

While I had expected it to be similar to tamagoyaki, a rather sweet egg Japanese dish, it was much closer to a roasted marshmallow in terms of texture and flavour. In some ways, it felt fluffier than even the most roasted of marshmallows. 

Overall, I thought it was a nice way to wrap up our mini-food adventure at the Miyagawa Morning Market.

# Takayama Matsuri Yatai Kaikan

Having had some satisfying bites, we made our way to the [*Takayama Festival Floats Exhibition Hall*](http://www.hidahachimangu.jp/english/index.html), situated past the *Sakurayama Hachiman Shrine*.

For some context, the [*Takayama Matsuri*](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5909.html) is one of Japan's most famous festivals, held twice a year in spring and autumn. The main highlight of this festival features 11-12 grandiose floats being paraded across the town of Takayama.

![sakurayama-hachiman-shrine](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/sakurayama-hachiman-shrine.JPG)

This exhibition hall displays four of the actual floats used in the festival, and visitors can learn more about the history and processes of the festival. The floats on display are also on rotation every few months.

The price of admission was a rather steep ¥1000 per adult, but with it also came tickets to *Nikkoukan*, another nearby exhibition hall.

Megan and I were each given an audio guide that provided us with more information about the festival with its surrounding customs, as well as the specific floats on display.

![yatai-kaikan](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/yatai-kaikan.JPG)

We then took a few paces to Nikkoukan, which was home to a one-tenth scale replica of the [Nikko Toshogu Shrine in Tochigi Prefecture](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3801.html). It was, if nothing, a nice place at which to rest and take a break from the cold.

# Kusakabe Folk Museum

Our last primarily-cultural landmark of the day was [the former residence of the Kusakabe family](http://www.kusakabe-mingeikan.com/english.html), middle-class merchants in the Meiji era (late 19th century). The now-converted museum was constructed with an architectural style mirroring that of the Edo period, and has been carefully preserved.

![kusakabe-folk-museum-1](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/kusakabe-folk-museum-1.JPG)

As we explored the residence, we were able to glean various interesting insights about the lifestyle of Takayama's middle-class more than 100 years ago.

Admission was ¥500 per adult.

# Lunch: Sushi Dining Nob

At this point, we had been walking for almost 4 hours, and were mostly definitely starving, not to mention feeling some form of "templed-out". We decided to have our lunch at [*Sushi Dining Nob*](https://www.facebook.com/nob.sushidining/), a rather quiet restaurant slightly outside of the main touristy area.

We decided to splurge a little bit and share 150g of Hida beef steak, as well as an assortment of sushi.

![lunch_sushi](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/lunch_sushi.JPG)

This was our first proper meal since arriving in Japan, and I simply could not have thought of a more perfect option. Every piece of sushi was delicious, and proudly boasted how perfectly prepared every ingredient was.

![lunch_beef-1](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/lunch_beef-1.JPG)

The steak that came while we were in the middle of going through our sushi platter was the cherry on top. We'd already had Hida beef earlier in the morning, but this steak felt even more satisfying. The yet-sizzling pot on which it was served made it that much more palatable, and at this point in the blog I am already running out of synonyms to describe the food we have had so far. On the first half of the first day of the trip no less!

![lunch_beef-2](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/takayama-walking-tour-1/lunch_beef-2.JPG)

Our lunch came to ¥7463. The steak itself cost ¥3500. While definitely not super budget-friendly, I just thought about how it would've cost maybe double that amount if it was served in Singapore.
