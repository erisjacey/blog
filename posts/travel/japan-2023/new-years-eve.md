We had actually planned to have a glorious day at [Shirakawago](https://www.vill.shirakawa.lg.jp/en/), a UNESCO World Heritage Site that kinda looks like the Japanese version of [The Shire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shire). However, when we woke up, we realised how "hard" we had worked the past two days, and decided to take a chill pill for the day. We would go to Shirakawago the next day instead, after checking out of our hotel and before heading to Kanazawa.

# Lunch: Kikyou-ya

Of course, we still needed to eat good food, so after a nice morning of staying in, we headed out to search for some. We were thinking about what specialties in the area we'd not yet tried, and at least for me, one of them was Takayama ramen. We consulted Google for a good ramen place, and after checking out some places that were unfortunately closed for the new year, we chanced upon [*Kikyou-ya*](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-14412299/).

![lunch_facade](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/lunch_facade.JPEG)

[Takayama ramen](https://tabimaniajapan.com/japanese-food/local-ramen-in-takayama-2) differs quite a bit from the popular tonkotsu ramen, in that soy sauce-based broth with dashi stock is instead used as the soup base. More on the other differences later.

![lunch_menu](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/lunch_menu.JPEG)

When we entered the restaurant, we found that it was completely family-run, and apparently has been so [for more than half a century](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/spot/02301-14412299/). There were quite a few nifty trinkets proudly being displayed. We even saw one of those old fat TVs that looked like it was made in the 1990s or something. Pretty cute.

Anyway, as far as our orders went, I got the regular chashu ramen, while Megan got the regular wonton ramen. It was supposed to be our brunch, so we definitely could've gotten the large portions, but we were smart enough to save some stomach space for dessert afterwards.

![lunch_ramen](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/lunch_ramen.JPG)

Megan had had some of this style of ramen the previous day, but we were both excited nonetheless because of the restaurant's long-standing history as a ramen shop. This meant that the food just **had** to be good, didn't it? For me, the homely atmosphere of the place and the usual inviting disposition of the family running it played a huge part too.

This was my first taste of soy sauce-based ramen, and it felt very different yet as rich as the tonkotsu ramen I'd come to love. The broth was much lighter and distinctly delicious. As the proverbial cherry on top, the chashu gave all the Hida beef we'd had a run for their money, as every bite of it was so tender and released all that brothy goodness it had been soaking. 

| Food                   | Cost      |
| :---                   | :---      |
| Chashu ramen (regular) | ¥1100     |
| Wonton ramen (regular) | ¥850      |
| **Total**              | **¥1950** |

## Dessert: Meiho Gelato Hanasaski

We started looking for a dessert place after our hearty meal, and saw that there was [*Meiho Gelato Hanasaki*](https://meihogelato-hanasaki.com/), a café specialising in gelato.

I got the matcha gelato alongside a croffle, while Megan got their signature milk gelato on a cone.

![dessert_food](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/dessert_food.JPG)

Turns out, even in the winter, ice cream is the way to go after some good ramen. The matcha and croffle paired nicely together, and according to Megan, the milk gelato was pretty good too.

I forgot to document how much each of our items was, but our total came up to ¥1190.

# Netflix and ch*ll

Not much to say here. We spent the afternoon just lounging in our hotel room. I think we started our binge of Season 2 of Marvel's *What If...?* before *someone* started getting sleepy.

# Dinner: 7-Eleven goodies

We stopped being lazy when it came time to eat again, but as we had promised our currently more broke selves, we decided to have a more budget-friendly dinner from 7-Eleven.

![dinner_food](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/dinner_food.JPG)

*I think we might have ordered too much. So much for being budget-friendly...*

In case you don't know, the Japanese convenience store, also known as [konbini](https://www.japan.travel/en/japan-magazine/2002_konbini/), is quite a haven, at least for tourists. On top of having a lot of daily essentials for purchase, the food sold here is generally of high-quality, so much so that it's possible to have one or a few full meals just from here.

Needless to say, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. To quote Megan, "it was awesome".

But wait!

If you thought that's all we had bought...

![dinner_dessert](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/dinner_dessert.JPG)

I don't recall us having finished all of our dessert because of how full we had gotten. Our gluttony selves enjoyed struggling to take several bites.

![dinner_chips](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/dinner_chips.JPG)

We also tried a bit of the Hida beef-flavoured chips that we had bought, but this was by far our most underwhelming purchase of the lot. It tasted way too artificial, it was too pepper-y and it was not beef-y enough.

# Year-end countdown

I was quite forunate to have seen online that Takayama does have [special events to celebrate the coming of the new year](https://centrip-japan.com/article/1502.html). Out we went again at 11 PM to experience Takayama's way of entering 2024.

## Sakurayama Hachimangu Shrine

The first of two places we went to was back to [the Shinto shrine that fronted the Takayama Matsuri Yatai Kaikan](http://www.hidahachimangu.jp/english/).

![countdown_sakurayama-hachimangu-shrine](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/countdown_sakurayama-hachimangu-shrine.JPG)

### Dondoyaki

At the top of the stairs, which was where the shrine was, we saw a bonfire around which people gathered. Apparently, [dondoyaki](https://livejapan.com/en/in-tokyo/in-pref-tokyo/in-tokyo_train_station/article-a0000867/) is a tradition in Japan, wherein bonfires are placed as a traditional spiritial purification. The smoke from the fire is supposed to send the Shinto deity Toshigami, who would come to earth during New Year's, back home to heaven. While not the most environmentally-friendly, it was pretty neat.

![countdown_fire](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/countdown_fire.JPG)

There was a queue that started to form in front of the shrine. Megan and I joined it, and I assumed it was to enter the shrine at the stroke of midnight for further festivities inside. As it got closer to 12 AM, waves and even more waves of people showed up. I had not expected how many folks, including tourists, would turn up in this quaint village and at this time.

### Hatsumode

As the countdown to midnight ended, there were no fireworks, but equally exciting was the fact the queue started to move. Soon, we were able to go into the shrine.

![countdown_hatsumode](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/countdown_hatsumode.JPG)

Once inside, there was a hall, the front of which had a large wooden box (Saisenbako). It was where we could pray for a good year, as part of the Japanese custom known as [Hatsumode](https://asianinspirations.com.au/experiences/experience-hatsumode-the-japanese-new-year-tradition/#:~:text=Stand%20before%20the%20large%20wooden,step%20away%20from%20the%20box.).

![countdown_hatsumode-ii](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/countdown_hatsumode-ii.JPG)

Apparently, there are steps involved in this ritual, including tossing a coin into the box, bowing twice, clapping your hands twice, starting your prayers, and finally bowing once. Despite practising them in my head, I completely choked when I went up, and just chucked my coins into the box and did a quick bow before moving on.

### Drinking sake

Another Japanese tradition on New Year's Day is [drinking sake](https://sakeonline.com.au/blogs/news/the-japanese-custom-of-drinking-sake-on-a-new-years-day). Apparently, it is supposed to ward off sickness for the year ahead, and also invite peace within the household. Weird things to symbolise with alcohol, but it was cool to drink the cup of free sake they were offering here.

![countdown_sake](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/countdown_sake.JPG)

### Omikuji

[Omikuji](https://blog.japanwondertravel.com/what-is-omikuji-29421#toc2) is a fortune slip to tell you how lucky you will be for the year, in aspects such as love, health and money. It is popular for people to get one during this time as well. 

![countdown_omikuji](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/countdown_omikuji.JPEG)

For the fun of it, Megan bought one (¥200), and her fortune was supposed to be pretty good this year.

*A picture of someone with supposedly good fortune for 2024!*

As we started leaving the shrine, we saw that there was still an insane queue to enter. Mind you, this was at about 12:20 AM. Good thing we started queuing really early, eh.

![countdown_queue](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/countdown_queue.JPG)

## Kokubunji Temple

We went to the other smaller place people would gather for the new year, [a Buddhist temple](https://www.hida.jp/english/touristattractions/takayamacity/historyandculture/4000178.html). We had already passed by it earlier as it was nearer to our hotel, but we figured the other shrine would have a grander atmosphere and more things to do. Thankfully, we were right.

![countdown_kokubunji-temple_before](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/new-years-eve/countdown_kokubunji-temple_before.JPG)

*Kokubunji Temple at about 11 AM*

At this temple, there is the ringing of temple bells 108 times, in a custom known as [Joya-no-Kane](https://matcha-jp.com/en/1340). People could also climb up the bell tower to ring the bell, but at this point we were pretty tired and decided to just soak in the New Year's Day atmosphere one last time before heading back to our hotel.

# My thoughts

In retrospect, this was a much-needed rest day, considering our first two days ended up being some of the "busiest" days of our trip. It also helped us gather the energy to head out, into the dark and cold, to experience this town's version of celebrating January 1st. It was different from the standard city-fare's way of fireworks and loud music, but it was actually preferable in some ways. I felt more connected to Japan's traditions, and the atmosphere was calmer and more peaceful. The one similarity was the insane crowds though. Still not a fan of that.
