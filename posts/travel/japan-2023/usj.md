I had been looking forward to coming back [here](https://www.usj.co.jp/web/en/us) ever Megan and I were planning our trip. I knew it was going to be extremely crowded given its popularity. To circumvent having to wait 3.5 hours for the [best ride I'd gone on to this day](https://member.usj.co.jp/e/attraction/jurassic-park-the-flying-dinosaur.html), we purchased express tickets just for this one ride.

# No breakfast?!

The one anomaly that happened today was us skipping breakfast. This was a strategic move on our part. We didn't have any more complimentary meals at the hotel, and we were going to have our fill and then some at the theme park itself.

# Universal Studios Japan... and its swarm of tourists

In hindsight, it might have been a good idea to reach the park well before its opening hours, because when we got there at 8:30 AM, we found that *so many people* had already beaten us to the punch.

# Hollywood

Nevertheless, according to the [official USJ app](https://www.usj.co.jp/web/en/us/enjoy/app), the waiting times for the rides were still manageable in general, so we made a beeline for the nearest rollercoaster.

## [Hollywood Dream - The Ride](https://www.usj.co.jp/web/en/us/attractions/hollywood-dream-the-ride)

Megan was not the most fond of thrilling rollercoasters and needed a bit of convincing to go on this ride. I was glad she eventually agreed, because it turned out to be one of the better rides here, and I think she would say the same.

While it did have a couple of novelties like famous pop songs playing during the ride, the thrilling drops were fairly standard, which was not a bad thing at all.

We waited about 40 min for this ride, and thankfully this was the longest we had to wait for a ride the entire day.

There was also a [backdrop variant](https://www.usj.co.jp/web/en/us/attractions/hollywood-dream-the-ride-backdrop) which would go through the same course, except we would all be facing backwards. While it looked really cool, Megan was like "no". I thought fair enough, and maybe it was time to fill our bellies for the first time today.

We shared a turkey bacon sandwich and I got a standard cup of coffee for myself (¥1350). The combination was a pretty good pick-me-up and gave us enough fuel for the next attraction and beyond.

## [Sesame Street 4-D Movie Magic](https://www.usj.co.jp/web/en/us/attractions/sesame-street-4-d-movie-magic)

This ride was more of a short cinematic experience, wherein we would all sit in a theatre-like area while wearing 4-D glasses. The characters would appear to jump out of the screen, and at the same time, physical effects like our chairs moving and water being sprayed at us during opportune moments were supposed to enhance our immersion.

The weird thing was that the entire presentation was in Japanese. I didn't understand anything that was going on, except that the overarching theme was supposed to be *imagination*. The whole thing felt trippy and almost cult-like, but in a fairly entertaining way.

On the way to our next zone, there was a shop selling cream-coated chocolate churro that looked irresistable (¥700). While it was indeed sweet and an interesting concept, it didn't deviate too much from a standard churro.

# Minion Park

I don't think this albeit small area was around when I visited 5 years ago, so it was nice to see an enhancement to the park besides the newly-built *Super Nintendo World*. While I didn't really care for the theme in this zone, there was a ride here that seemed pretty worthwhile checking out.

## [Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem](https://www.usj.co.jp/web/en/us/attractions/despicable-me-minion-mayhem)

This was a 4-D ride that ended up being a lot more fun than I had expected, considering my pre-conceived notions of the theme. I thought it was going to be a kiddy ride, but it was actually pretty thrilling.

We tried a bucket of crème brûlée-flavoured popcorn (¥550). We would later find out that each zone in USJ would each sell two unique flavours, so a popcorn enthusiast would have a field day trying out as many of them as possible. On top of that, there were also unique premium popcorn buckets that could double as souvenirs, but we thought they were too expensive and unnecessary to buy.

# The Wizarding World of Harry Potter

Our express passes gave us timed entries to *The Wizarding World of Harry Potter* and *Super Nintendo World*, saving us the hassle of having to apply for an e-ticket. It was already 1 PM at this point, and about time for us to head to the former.

![harry-potter-1](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/usj/harry-potter-1.jpg)

*The two zones mentioned were unsurprisingly the biggest draw in the park.*

While it would have been nice to take our time in exploring this part of USJ, we needed to go to Nintendo World in less than two hours. Thankfully, our express passes gave us express entry to the best ride in this zone, so we gladly made our way to the ride entrance to take advantage of that.

## [Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey](https://www.usj.co.jp/web/en/us/attractions/harry-potter-and-the-forbidden-journey)

It felt really nice to skip the queue instead of having to wait close to two hours the previous time. As for the ride itself, it was definitely as fun as it was the first time. Megan liked it too, except for the part where (*spoiler alert*) there were two dementors hovering around us while we were suspended in the air.

To complete the Harry Potter experience, we shared a cup of butterbeer (¥700). It was also my first time trying it, and I found its flavour profile profoundly sweet and savoury at the same time. Megan was tempted to buy the premium mug souvenir, but like the popcorn buckets, they were really costly, so it was a no-go in the end.

We also got a nifty-looking meat pie (¥700), which was pretty good.

## [Ollivanders](https://www.usj.co.jp/web/en/us/attractions/ollivanders)

The last thing we did in the Harry Potter area was an interesting show wherein the character Ollivander would display bouts of magic through the strange properties of the wands he owned. I'm sure the kids were pretty mystified.

![harry-potter-2](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/usj/harry-potter-2.jpg)

It was pretty funny to see that USJ had seemed to do a very good job at selling their merchandise, as we saw quite a number of people donning Gryffindor scarves. Some were even full-on cosplaying with their Harry Potter robes.

# Super Nintendo World

This area of the park was only completed in 2021, and as a gamer nerd myself, I really wanted to see what the fanfare was about in person. 

![nintendo-world-1](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/usj/nintendo-world-1.jpg)

To say I was blown away was par for the course. The heavy use of animatronics here, coupled with the vibrant colour scheme and accompanying themed music, really made me feel like I was within the game itself. I would say this part of the park makes *most of* the price of admission alone worth it.

There was also this nifty trend, where we could buy a watch that could interact with various objects and collect points. Not really sure what the points were for, and it seemed like another attempt at a cash grab, but I thought it was an novel concept nonetheless.

![nintendo-world-2](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/usj/nintendo-world-2.jpg)

## [Mario Kart: Koopa's Challenge](https://www.usj.co.jp/web/en/us/attractions/mario-kart-koopas-challenge)

We were once again able to use our express tickets for this ride, which was a godsend as we would have otherwise had to queue for close to two hours.

This ride was another stroke of innovation, as its goal was to make us feel like we were playing an actual game of *Mario Kart*. Each of us would were a specially procured hat, which would allow us to see a sort-of augmented reality around us. We were then "tasked" to aim at targets with our eyes in order to score as many points as possible. This time, the points had a purpose, as the top scorers would be showcased at the end of the ride. My hand-eye coordination was woefully unprepared and I did pretty terribly though.

While not the most thrilling of rides, it was definitely an interesting experience worth going for.

*They really spared no effort even when it came to the interior design of the waiting rooms!*

# Lunch: Kinopio's Café

It was admittedly pretty late into the afternoon, and while we weren't really hungry because we had been eating every now and then, we figured this was a good stopping point for a proper lunch. We headed to the [restaurant in Nintendo World]((https://www.usj.co.jp/web/en/us/restaurants/kinopios-cafe)) and found out that there was actually a queue to dine inside.

![lunch_restaurant](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/usj/lunch_restaurant.jpg)

Once we got inside, the cozy interior and apparent dedication to keeping the mushroom theme consistent made the wait worth it. We had ordered a mushroom pie, a mushroom omelette rice, and a thankfully-not-mushroom cream pastry dessert. The flavour was serviceable, but we knew coming into this park that much of the price of the food would be attributed to presentation and touristiness.

![lunch_food](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/usj/lunch_food.jpg)

In all, the total cost of the food was a hefty ¥5050, but considering how much excess cash we had and the fact that it was already our last day, we figured we would go baller mode today anyway.

After enjoying the atmosphere of Nintendo World a little more, and with our appetites fully sated, we headed back to Hollywood to go on another ride for which we had express passes.

This seemed like an old-school version of the Harry Potter ride prior, but it was still pretty good. As it turned out, it was actually one of, if not the oldest ride in USJ, and it was going to be closed permanently in a month or so. 

# Jurassic Park

## [The Flying Dinosaur](https://www.usj.co.jp/web/en/us/attractions/the-flying-dinosaur)

We inadvertently saved the best ride for last. Megan spent the whole day contemplating whether she would go for it, and in the end... I was going to go alone. This was an agreement we had, and since we had express passes for it as well, I figured it wouldn't take much time before I was done anyway.

This ride was just as amazing as I had remembered!

The fact that the cushion underneath us was loose meant that we could feel a lot of the G-forces as we were being ragdolled in the rollercoaster. Until I go to Six Flags or something, this ride will probably remain my favourite for the foreseeable future.

After exiting the ride with my hair all messed up, Megan and I walked around the theme park, visiting any corners we might have missed and buying some souvenirs at the shops until the theme park was about to close.

# Dinner: Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.

It had been a couple of hours since we last ate, so by this time, we were pretty famished. With an extremely bloated budget still, we decided to have our last dinner in Japan in a [completely western-style restaurant](https://bubbagump.jp/location/en/).

To start, we got this really interesting looking margarita combo with beer, appropriately called a *coronarita*. I found the transition in flavour from the citrus margarita to the corona as we drank more and more interesting.

![dinner_drinks](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/usj/dinner_drinks.jpg)

*Ignore my derpy face in the background.*

We instantly gobbled on our food as soon as they had been served. The shrimps and other grub were so savoury, and the various sauces and marinades were perfectly complementary.

![dinner_food](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/usj/dinner_food.jpg)

This glorious dinner cost a whopping ¥8811, but as I had been saying throughout this blog, it was *worth it*. While my hands were still oily and reeked of spices, I was really satisfied, not just with dinner, but also with how the entire day had gone.

# My thoughts

As far as my favourite parts of the day were, it was probably a tie between seeing Super Nintendo World in person and going on The Flying Dinosaur once again.

We didn't get to explore *Amity Village*, though we didn't see much reason to, as the Jaws ride was closed when we were there. There *was* this jumbo turkey leg being sold, which we sadly had to pass on due to stomachs not being big enough.

As expensive as it is, I would definitely recommend getting an express pass just to be able to go for as many rides as possible and reduce your frustrations with having to wait. After all, if you wanted to experience as much as USJ has to offer but were not able to, you would have to come again on a different day, and then it would be a greater cost in terms of time and money.

All in all, today was an excellent end to a really fun winter trip.
