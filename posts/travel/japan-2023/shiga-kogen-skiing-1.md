Guess whose turn it was to get sick...

# Breakfast: Hotel

We started our day as usual trying to fill our empty stomachs. When we had checked in yesterday, I think some of the things the staff had told us were lost in translation, as we found out today that breakfast (and later dinner as well) were included as part of our stay here.

Both meals, contrary to our previous ryokan stay, were served buffet-style, and seemed to have both local and international options. All in all, this was a welcome change, because even after our dinner yesterday, I was starting to miss the more western flavours a little more. Being able to control my portions was definitely needed as well, as my appetite was on the smaller side considering my health.

# Preparing to ski

Nevertheless, I thought we could set up our rental equipment and see how things go from there. After we had decided on our ski jacket and pants, all I could think of was how much of a hobo I looked, and how maybe I should get my own clothes before the next ski trip.

Suffice to say, the skiing did not go well at all. While Megan was pretty much a natural, I couldn't control my descent comfortably even while attempting [the snowplough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXUbCPuc4nw). I wish I could blame it on me not feeling well, or even the beginner slopes being too steep, but I think it was just a skill issue.

# Lunch

It was time to take a break for lunch, and we decided to redeem some of the vouchers we had gotten as part of our ski package bookings at one of the participating restaurants near the main ski area.

The food was more than serviceable, as it always is, but I found myself not being able to enjoy it myself due to not feeling well.

We headed back to our hotel, where I downed some Panadol and inadvertently took a very long nap until about 2 PM, meaning we only had about two hours left to ski. I guess the downside to skiing and winter trips in general is the fact that the sun sets way too early.

# A positive sign

I was thankfully feeling much better after the nap though, and went back to the slopes with Megan with some renewed confidence. This confidence became unwarranted immediately, as again I struggled to not stumble every few seconds or so. The process of continuously falling and trying to get back up again was so tiring, at one point I wanted to throw in the towel and call it a day.

Then, as if by some miracle, I figured out how to actually use my legs to come to an effective stop, and then skiing became so much more enjoyable. My main goal for the day became simply being able to go down the beginner slope without falling a single time. In one of our last (of very few in total) runs, I finally managed to. Yay...

# Dinner: Hotel

The sun had already begun to set at around 4:30, and that's also when the ski lifts were closing, so we called it then and went back to our hotel for dinner. The spread was pretty similar to our breakfast prior, but there were so many choices that it still felt fresh. The cherry on top was the main dish every guest was entitled to, of which Megan and I decided to share only one plate so that we still had stomach space for the other dishes.

We turned in early for the night after a job mediocrely done for myself.

# My thoughts

While most of the day was filled with frustrations, I think I managed to finally get the hang of at least the basics of skiing. I could understand the satisfying loop of doing multiple runs, taking a break or having a good meal, and then repeating the cycle all over again. I looked forward to our last full day here, with some assurance that there would be less snow on my buttocks in the end.
