On this day, Megan and I went on a day trip to [*Shinhotaka Ropeway*](https://shinhotaka-ropeway.jp/en/), a ropeway that takes visitors up the Northern Alps of Japan to heights of up to 2156 metres. At the top, we were supposed to be able to take in stunning views of the alps from various vantage points and at various angles. Needless to say, for someone who had not yet been to any mountain range of this scale, this sounded like a very interesting day trip.

To get to the lower station of Shinhotaka Ropeway from Takayama, we needed to take a bus that ran every hour so, and that cost ¥2200 per person. There was also a bus that connected [*Hirayu Onsen*](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1263/) and the ropeway, and that was the route we took at the end of the day to get back to Takayama.

The journey took us about 90 min to reach Shinhotaka Ropeway. For some additional info, it's the final station of the bus route, so you could sleep during the whole ride and not have to worry about missing the stop.

Upon reaching the lower station, appropriately called *Shinhotaka Onsen Station*, we found out that there were actually two ropeways. The first one was a 188m/4 min climb to *Nabedaira Kogen Station*, and you could actually drive to and park here. The second one was a longer 848m/7 min climb to the upper *Nishihotakaguchi Station*. Unlike the first one, the second ropeway featured a pretty nifty double-deck, but I personally didn't notice it because of how efficient the staff were in directing us to one of the decks.

There were variations in the combinations of tickets we could get, depending on whether we just needed the second ropeway, and if we needed a one-way ride or a full round trip. We had to go for the round trip for both ropeways, and that set us back ¥3300 per person.

*Nabedaira Kogen Station*

We explored both lower and middle stations, both of which had a handful of shops selling snacks and souvenirs. Ultimately though, there wasn't much to see or do, and the real attraction was the upper station anyway, so we quickly made our way there. We also hadn't eaten much yet, and there was supposed to be a restaurant at the top, so that was extra motivation.

# Lunch: Café Mount View

Because we knew exactly where our priorities lied, our first order of business upon reaching the upper station was unsurprisingly to eat some food. *Café Mount View* was the only restaurant here, and while there was one side of the room that offered pretty nice views of the mountains outside, we couldn't find seats there. There were **a lot** of people.

We were in the Okuhida region, which was still technically part of Takayama City, so the menu naturally offered Hida beef. Again. Notwithstanding the fact that we had a whole day of Hida beef the day before, we'd have been fools to not have it. Again.

We firstly shared a churro, which was prettily shaped in what I thought was a Japanese symbol or character. Gotta say, having something this crunchy as one of our first bites of the day was nothing short of glorious. It just made me hungrier for the main that I'd ordered.

![lunch_curry-rice](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/lunch_curry-rice.jpeg)

I had the curry rice with Hida beef. While the beef obviously did not disappoint, the star of this dish, in my opinion, was the curry. Its sweetness, combined with its richness, made a strong case for me to bump up my personal ranking of Japanese curry above curries from other cultures.

Megan, on the other hand, got the Takayama ramen with Hida beef. I asked her what she thought of it, and this was what she had to say:

"It was good."
