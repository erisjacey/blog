On this day, Megan and I went on a day trip to [*Shinhotaka Ropeway*](https://shinhotaka-ropeway.jp/en/), a ropeway that takes visitors up the Northern Alps of Japan to heights of up to 2156 metres. At the top, we were supposed to be able to take in stunning views of the alps from various vantage points and at various angles. Needless to say, for someone who had not yet been to any mountain range of this scale, this sounded like a very interesting day trip.

To get to the lower station of Shinhotaka Ropeway from Takayama, we needed to take a bus that ran every hour so, and that cost ¥2200 per person. There was also a bus that connected [*Hirayu Onsen*](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1263/) and the ropeway, and that was the route we took at the end of the day to get back to Takayama.

*Spot a mini ski resort that we passed by along the way!*

The journey took us about 90 min to reach Shinhotaka Ropeway. For some additional info, it's the final station of the bus route, so you could sleep during the whole ride and not have to worry about missing the stop.

Upon reaching the lower station, appropriately called *Shinhotaka Onsen Station*, we found out that there were actually two ropeways. The first one was a 188m/4 min climb to *Nabedaira Kogen Station*, and you could actually drive to and park here. The second one was a longer 848m/7 min climb to the upper *Nishihotakaguchi Station*. Unlike the first one, the second ropeway featured a pretty nifty double-deck, but I personally didn't notice it because of how efficient the staff were in directing us to one of the decks.

*Shinhotaka Onsen Station*

There were variations in the combinations of tickets we could get, depending on whether we just needed the second ropeway, and if we needed a one-way ride or a full round trip. We had to go for the round trip for both ropeways, and that set us back ¥3300 per person.

*Nabedaira Kogen Station*

We explored both lower and middle stations, both of which had a handful of shops selling snacks and souvenirs. Ultimately though, there wasn't much to see or do, and the real attraction was the upper station anyway, so we quickly made our way there. We also hadn't eaten much yet, and there was supposed to be a restaurant at the top, so that was extra motivation.

# Lunch: Café Mount View

Because we knew exactly where our priorities lied, our first order of business upon reaching the upper station was unsurprisingly to eat some food. *Café Mount View* was the only restaurant here, and while there was one side of the room that offered pretty nice views of the mountains outside, we couldn't find seats there. There were **a lot** of people.

![lunch_menu](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/lunch_menu.jpeg)

We were in the Okuhida region, which was still technically part of Takayama City, so the menu naturally offered Hida beef. Again. Notwithstanding the fact that we had a whole day of Hida beef the day before, we'd have been fools to not have it. Again.

![lunch_churro-thing](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/lunch_churro-thing.jpeg)

We firstly shared a churro, which was prettily shaped in what I thought was a Japanese symbol or character. Gotta say, having something this crunchy as one of our first bites of the day was nothing short of glorious. It just made me hungrier for the main that I'd ordered.

![lunch_curry-rice](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/lunch_curry-rice.jpeg)

I had the curry rice with Hida beef. While the beef obviously did not disappoint, the star of this dish, in my opinion, was the curry. Its sweetness, combined with its richness, made a strong case for me to bump up my personal ranking of Japanese curry above curries from other cultures.

![lunch_ramen](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/lunch_ramen.jpeg)

Megan, on the other hand, got the Takayama ramen with Hida beef. I asked her what she thought of it, and this was what she had to say:

"It was good."

# Observation deck

After yet another banger of a meal, we finally had the energy to head back into the cold and onto the observation deck. This spot was undoubtedly the highlight of the day trip for me, as I basked in the amazing views of the snow-capped mountains all around me. If not for the fact that we still had other places to explore, I could have easily stayed here for quite a while.

![observation-deck_mountain-range](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/observation-deck_mountain-range.jpeg)

In the middle of the observation deck was a dome-like shelter with a heater in the middle, so people wouldn't have to worry about freezing to death here.

![observation-deck_shelter](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/observation-deck_shelter.jpg)

Apart from tourists wanting to have a nice backdrop in their photos, on the fences of the deck were also various signs, which gave some information about the names of the mountains we could see.

![observation-deck_us](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/observation-deck_us.jpeg)

*Of course, we were tourists ourselves, so we **had** to ask someone else to help take a photo of us.*

# Exploring the trail

A level below the observation deck was a snowy expanse, where we could see families playing with the snow and just generally having a good time. It was my first time seeing snowball maker tools being used to make the perfect snowballs. Would've been nice to have one so I could throw some snowballs at Megan.

Anyway, we ventured further away from the main area and found a few more cool vantage points to view the mountains. On top of that, as we continued walking for half an hour or so, we soon realised there was no dead end, and that the path evolved into an entire hiking trail that would eventually lead us to another area of the mountain range. This was 100% confirmed when we saw a couple of hikers, decked out in their full hiking gear, walking in the **opposite** direction from us. At this point, we didn't wanna risk getting lost/stranded and started heading back.

![trail](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/trail.jpeg)

On the signposts in the deeper parts of the trail, we would see a few freshly-created snow ducks. And on the way back, we saw a pair of hikers making the exact same snow ducks on another signpost. We thought it was a pretty fun gesture by them.

# Hirayu Onsen

We took the two ropeways down back to the lower station, where we boarded a bus towards Hirayu Onsen. Just before boarding the bus, we took the chance to get another unique snack, a pair of *Hida beef buns*, one of which was the spicy variant, at ¥600 per bun. For the umpteenth time, the beef was soft and the sauce in the bun was delicious.

![hida-beef-bun](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/hida-beef-bun.jpeg)

For some context, Hirayu Onsen is [one of five hot spring villages in the Okuhida Onsen-go area](https://visitgifu.com/see-do/okuhida-hot-spring-villages/). Upon reaching, we saw a hot spring resort a few minutes from the bus terminal, and I thought it maybe would've been nice to spend a night here, just to soak in the Okuhida village atmosphere.

![hirayu-onsen_village](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/hirayu-onsen_village.jpeg)

*This was taken after we'd come back from the waterfall. I thought the evening sky was a pretty cool contrast from the bus terminal foreground.*

## Hirayu Waterfall

We kinda were stuck with coming to Hirayu Onsen because the other bus that would directly get to Takayama from Shinhotaka Onsen Station was going to arrive much later. However, we took advantage of this by checking out one of the attractions here.

[*Hirayu Waterfall*](https://www.japan-experience.com/discover/takayama/attractions-excursions/hirayu-otaki-gifu-waterfall) was reachable from the onsen village via a relatively comfortable 1.6km/30 min stroll. This walk would see passing by the quiet Hirayu Onsen Ski Area. The only thing that irked me about it was seeing another sign warning us of bears; because of this, I would spend a lot of the 1 hour walk looking into the trees on the side for any suspicious movement. I might've been too paranoid, but I thought it didn't hurt to make sure only humans were around, you know?

![hirayu-waterfall_sign](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/hirayu-waterfall_sign.jpeg)

When we got to the waterfall, we were profoundly... disappointed. It was supposed to be 64m high, but it didn't feel that grand of a sight. Maybe it was the fact that we were fenced out and couldn't go closer to the fall itself, but it looked pretty underwhelming. I had to crop our photo of the waterfall to try and make it look bigger here. Nevertheless, while a pleasant enough walk to get here, I think if you do come to Hirayu Onsen, it might be more worthwhile to stay in the onsen than come see the waterfall.

## Random foot bath

While waiting for the bus at Hirayu Onsen to finally head back to Takayama, I was walking around the bus terminal and came across a free foot bath. I was very sad that I couldn't soak my feet in it, because my tights extended all the way to my feet and doubled as socks, so I had Megan try it. This was what she had to say about it:

"It was refreshing."

![hirayu-onsen_foot-bath](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/hirayu-onsen_foot-bath.jpeg)

I bet it would've felt really nice to soak my feet in warm water after a second consecutive day of logging more than 20k steps, but alas. We took the bus back to Takayama, and I was very much looking forward to dinner regardless.

# Dinner: Matuskiushi

When we were finally back in Takayama, it was already 7 PM, which was considered late. We had not made any restaurant bookings, and were scrambling to find a place. After walking for quite a bit and trying a few restaurants that were already either closed or fully booked, we managed to find a seat at [*Matsukiushi*](https://www.matsuki-ushi.com/en/), a steakhouse selling... whattaya know, A5 Hida beef.

![dinner_facade](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/dinner_facade.jpeg)

It seemed like the most popular choices at this restaurant were the Hida beef set meals, which could either come with rice or an 8-piece sushi set. Megan and I shared a rice set and a sushi set, and she got the ribeye steak while I opted for the sirloin.

We were first served some salad and miso soup, which tasted pretty standard.

![dinner_salad](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/dinner_salad.jpeg)

When the sushi came, they started explaining what each piece was, from flounder, various tuna, and sweet shrimp, to... you guessed it, Hida beef (with uni on top). The sushi looked so good, that I felt like we should have gotten our own sushi set, so we didn't have to share. The couple who came after us got the memo from looking at our food and we saw them get served a sushi set each. How fortuitous.

Still, while a few pieces like the flounder were too chewy for my liking, most pieces were excellent appetisers, as we waited for the main star of the night to arrive.

![dinner_sushi](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/dinner_sushi.jpeg)

This was our last foray into Hida beef goodness in the trip, and it was simply the perfect send-off. Unlike the previous time we had beef steak (yesterday), we had rice alongside our meat, and the combination of the rice with the very juicy and even softer beef seemed like a perfect harmony. I tried my best to absolutely savour every bite.

![dinner_beef](/images/posts/travel/japan-2023/shinhotaka-ropeway/dinner_beef.jpeg)

While the food was really, really good, this was one of the pricier restaurants in our whole trip. I guess you do get what you pay for though.

| Food                         | Cost             |
| :---                         | :---             |
| Sirloin (100g) with rice     | ¥5000            |
| Ribeye (100g) with sushi     | ¥7000            |
| Extra rice bowl              | ¥200             |
| **Total**                    | **¥12200 (!!!)** |

We agreed to have more modest meals the next day, so we bought some food at 7-Eleven on the way back to our hotel before calling it a day.

# My thoughts

Shinhotaka Ropeway was a really fun day trip from Takayama. In my opinion, it's absolutely worth it to spend a full day there, despite having to overcome my stupid urge to throw snowballs at Megan. I just couldn't get enough of the views of the alps. Depending on where your interests lie, you might even find it meaningful to include a night's stay in one of the ryokans in Okuhida Onsen-go. Or even literally go the extra mile and do a hike in the mountains.
