Alas, it was time to say goodbye to snow for the rest of the trip, as we were headed back to Osaka. Our route today involved a series of buses, trains and subways, passing by the cities Nagano and Nagoya. It was going to be a whole day affair, totaling to about seven hours long. Needless to say, this blog could have been done without, but I'll just finish it for the sake of completeness. Plus, we did try something "new" today.

# Breakfast: Hotel

As was tradition, breakfast was the first on our agenda. Nothing much to say here, other than we didn't know how much we were going to miss this particular hotel breakfast even long after leaving.

# To Nagano

Upon checkout, we saw this nifty device showing the temperature outside. We thought it was pretty serendipitous that we were moving on today, as maybe we would have frozen over with how low the number went.

The first leg of our mini-odyssey was a 1.5h bus ride to Nagano Station. While it was largely uneventful, I liked how we had planned our transport itinerary in accordance with meal times. While we weren't able to fully explore the city, we could see how proud the locals were of its history of being a past host of the winter olympics in 1998.

# Lunch: Shinshu Soba no Kusabue Midori

We had about an hour or so for lunch before we had to board our next train. We were trying to figure out what we hadn't tried so far. As it turned out, [Nagano Prefecture was pretty famous for its soba](https://www.japan.travel/en/au/story/insiders-guide-soba/#:~:text=Soba%20is%20most%20strongly%20associated,than%20anywhere%20else%20in%20Japan.), so after buying [a few Nagano apple-flavoured souvenir treats](https://www.snowmonkeyresorts.com/activities/fruits-of-nagano/nagano-apples-some-of-the-best-in-japan/), we decided to try some at a [soba restaurant within Nagano Station](https://kusabue-nagano.owst.jp/en/).

*I didn't know there was a custom to eating soba noodles.*

Megan ordered a soupy version of soba noodles, which was admittedly pretty rare in Singapore.

I stayed on the safe side and got some dry soba. While the hot soupy soba was maybe more appropriate for the weather, the familiarity of the texture and flavour profile of the dry soba made me enjoy the latter more. Of course, this variant was superior to the ones I had had for the same price tag at home.

Our total for this meal ended up amounting to Â¥2,580. It didn't break the bank, but as we had a train to meet, the meal wasn't as satisfying as it could have been with the time crunch.

# To Nagoya

Our train ride to Nagoya was by far the longest part of our travels today, and needed about three hours. The views with which we were met were drastically different from a lot of white we had been seeing the past week or so.

# Dinner: McDonald's

When we we got to Nagoya, then sun had already almost completely set, which meant that it was time to get some dinner before our last shinkansen of the trip to go to Osaka. We looked up our options within Nagoya Station itself, and settled on our first and only fast food experience in Japan.

We got a pair of pretty interesting looking burgers, and shared some fries, a McFlurry and (what I think was) a frappuccino. Even the fast food here felt superior in terms of overall presentation and taste. I'm totally not biased.

We paid for this meal by card, so I forgot how much the meal cost in yen, but I got billed SG$16.26 on my banking app after conversion.

# To Osaka

From Nagoya, it was just a short ~1h bullet train ride to reach Shin-Osaka Station, and then several stations on the Osaka subway to reach *Shinsaibashi*, which was where our hotel for this last part of the trip was. We were back in the city where we had landed, and completely gone were any sight of mountains or snow; they had been replaced by buildings, street lights, and *lots of people*.

*The "lots of people" part will be more emphasized in the next two posts.*

# My thoughts

Nothing much to say for this day, other than it did feel oddly comfortable to be back in a more crowded city. Variety is always good, and a whole day of just traveling allowed me to prepare for the next few action-packed days ahead.

*I really do miss the snow though.*
