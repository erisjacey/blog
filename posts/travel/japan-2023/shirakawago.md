It was time for Megan and I to check out of our hotel in Takayama and move on to our next destination, Kanazawa. It involved two consecutive 1 hour bus rides, with a stop in the middle happening at [*Shirakawago*](https://www.vill.shirakawa.lg.jp/en/). We were supposed to come here yesterday, but we used the day to rest, and in doing so saved a return bus trip and therefore some money.

This settlement, nestled in the mountains of Gifu and Toyama Prefectures, attained its UNESCO world heritage site status in 1995. The village is famed for its tradiitonal gassho-zukuri farmhouses. These centuries-old houses are appropriately named for their intricate triangular thatched roofs.

Due to the changes we had made in our itinerary to accommodate the bus availabilities, we were only able to stop by this village for around 2 hours. While this amount of time might be enough for some, there have been some recommendations to spend 3-6 hours to see the observation deck and some houses from the inside. Perhaps a must-do as well would have been an overnight stay at one of the farmhouses for a pretty unique experience.

Anyway, considering the limited time we had, upon arrival, we immediately made a beeline to the observatory deck, which took about a 15 minute walk up a sloping pathway. My out-of-shape self was definitely panting when we reached the top.

*The views were worth it though!*

After spending some time taking obligatory selfies and pictures of the village from this vantage point, we climbed back down and took a very pleasant stroll along the village. I could see why this place got its world heritage site status as the combination of the snow-coated farmhouses with the mountainous backdrop evoked a sense of calmness our iPhone cameras simply couldn't capture.

We didn't have the time to enter many of the houses besides those repurposed into souvenir shops, but we did manage to check out the one that held the physical certificate given by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in 1995, along with a little more historical background on the village itself.

# My thoughts

While it's true that Shirakawago did not offer much in the way of touristy activities, the atmosphere I experienced here was definitely tranquil and not to be missed. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise to not have been able to opt for the farmhouse stay this time; I have a really good reason to come back again in a heartbeat, and give the village the time and consideration it deserved. Things like exploring the interiors of the beautifully-constructed houses, seeing the sun setting underneath the snowy mountains in the distance, and having a fully traditional dinner in one of the guesthouses. *Maybe next time*...
