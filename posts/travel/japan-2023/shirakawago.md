It was time for Megan and I to check out of our hotel in Takayama and move on to our next destination, Kanazawa. It involved two consecutive 1 hour bus rides, with a stop in the middle happening at [Shirakawago](https://www.vill.shirakawa.lg.jp/en/). We were supposed to come here yesterday, but we used the day to rest, and in doing so saved a return bus trip and therefore some money.

This settlement, nestled in the mountains of Gifu and Toyama Prefectures, attained its UNESCO world heritage site status in 1995. The village is famed for its tradiitonal gassho-zukuri farmhouses. These centuries-old houses are appropriately named for their intricate triangular thatched roofs.
