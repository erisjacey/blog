A few buddies of mine and I went to Nusa Penida in Bali from 23-27 May for a solid 3 days of diving. We snagged a good promo with Scuba Junkie Penida at ADEX this year and signed up for a set of 9 fun dives with them along with a couple day stay at their integrated resort.

# Diving in Nusa Penida

Credits to Clement for taking and editing the following pics in this section.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVED DIVING IN NUSA PENIDA!

The main attraction to diving here all-year round is definitely to see manta rays, and we were treated to 4-5 of them on our first day alone. A stone's throw away from the island is a cleaning station for these wonderful creatures, and we got to see them gliding along not far below the surface. It was quite surreal to see quite a few of them in the wild for the first time, and it was definitely one of the highlights of this trip.

A lot of the dives offered on the island were drift dives, wherein we'd be swept along a sloping reef that descends to a few hundred metres. And oh my, they really weren't kidding about the currents here. I didn't get much experience with much drift diving prior to this, so it was sometimes quite scary when a surge would come and attempt to sweep us AWAY from the reef.

That being said, the presence of such currents meant that there was a chance we could see some cool stuff drifting along with us as well, and there was absolutely no shortage of that this trip. 

On our second day, we got to see an ocean sunfish (also referred to as mola). Lots of people actually come to this island specifically to see this giant but derpy bony fish, but they generally only appear during the cold season of July-October, so being able to cross an encounter with one off my bucket list was an extremely pleasant surprise for sure.

On top of that, on our third day, we were blessed with a thresher shark sighting in one of our drift dives. Even though I'd seen a lot when I went to Malapascua in 2020, seeing one so unexpectedly this time made this encounter very special in its own way.

*It's a bit faint, but you can see its silhouette in the centre of this picture!*

Of course, apart from the pelagics we saw, I'd say the reefs and marine life were generally quite healthy, and it was definitely nice to see such richness in fauna underwater.

The last interesting thing to mention was how cold the water was at times. We were warned that water temperatures here are unpredictable and can range from 20-30°C. Even though we were given 5mm full-body wetsuits, I still felt wholly unprepared during the colder dives when temperatures dropped to as low as 22°C. I'd have much rather have dived in the warmer temperatures, but hey, if that's the small price to pay to see such amazing stuff, then it was definitely way worth it.

# Land tours

Because our dives would end around 2pm, we had a lot of time to explore the island. 

## East tour

On our second day, we took a tour to the east side of the island. The tour was really free and easy, and like all the land tours we did on this trip, our driver was kind enough to wait for us to explore each stop at our own pace before we were ready to move on.

We first visited the top of the cliff that overlooked Atuh Beach. There was a mini hike that we had to do to get a better vantage point, and let's just say it was a terrible indication of our fitness levels for the Mount Batur hike we had to do later in the trip.

We then stopped by the cliffside that led to Diamond Beach. This time, there was a set of stairs that would lead us to the beach itself, but we were too lazy/tired to head down, so we just chilled on the cliff and enjoyed the breeze and view from above.

## West tour

On our third day, we were taken to further west in the island. Our first stop included sights of Angel's Billabong and Broken Beach. We took a leisure walk around the landscape and enjoyed the bright sun shining down on us.

Our next and last stop took us to Kelingking Hill/Beach, probably the most famous sight in Nusa Penida. There was another hike down some stairs to the beach itself, but it would've apparently taken us 45 min just to get down, and we were really lazy, so again all we did was take some pictures and then left for dinner.

*Picture of Kelingking coming soon!*

# My thoughts

The diving here was absolutely sublime, and the landscapes during the day tours were some pretty interesting contrasting sights. I am very glad to have essentially 100%-ed this island in just a few days, by exploring most of what it offered and seeing its main diving attractions in the manta rays and molas.

I would definitely recommend anyone who even remotely likes diving to come to Nusa Penida for a chance to see the manta rays and molas and experience great drift diving. Just take note that the currents can be quite crazy and that the water can be quite cold so having several dive trips under your belt would make your experience here more comfortable.
