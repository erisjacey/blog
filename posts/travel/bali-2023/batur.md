Credits to Clement for taking and editing some of the pics in this post.

After a few glorious days of diving Nusa Penida, we headed up north in Bali to Ubud for the second leg of our trip. Its highlight was supposed to be an early morning hike up Mount Batur to catch the sunrise. "It's going to be worth it," my friend Clement retorted.

To say the least, I was terribly unprepared for what was about to come.

We woke up at the ungodly time of 2am in order to be picked up by a driver and be taken to the hike's starting point. There, we met our guide for the hike and shortly after commenced our ascent.

I had not steeled myself for how tired I'd find myself barely few minutes of walking up some uneven slopes. Thank God for the frequent breaks we took. During them, we'd peer over the edge of the mountain and overlook the town residing nearby, most of which was presumably still asleep. After all, who would be awake so early in the morning here but overzealous tourists vying for some artificial sense of accomplishment, along with local hiking guides who do this so often it's probably child's play to them?

We eventually made it to where touring jeeps would stop and park themselves. I thought we were done. But I was then told we'd only reached the halfway point of the hike up...

Thankfully, the second half of the ascent felt a little bit easier. The slopes were steeper but we took more frequent breaks, which meant I could use my legs more than my abysmal stamina to carry myself up the mountain. Before we knew it, we saw the light at the end of the tunnel (figuratively, of course).

As if all our luck had been spent in Nusa Penida, it turned out that it was really foggy at the top, so there were only a few moments for us to enjoy the view from the summit and snag some pics.

*What was I supposed to be seeing?!*

Regardless, we spent an hour or so at the top resting, congratulating ourselves for a job terribly done, and trying our best to enjoy the sunrise. I found out only then that Mount Batur was supposed to be 1717m tall. That was pretty cool.

We then began our hike down the mountain. I discovered an issue with my footwear. As it turned out, the traction on my shoes was so terrible, and it was much easier for me to slip and fall if I was walking on small rocks or something. While I did face that sometimes during the hike up, the problem was  exacerbated walking down. It was not fun.

When we'd reached the end, our guide told us the hike was 8km in total length. In the picture below, which was taken right at the end, you can see Mount Batur's summit in the distant middle ground. That's where we were!

# My thoughts

Thanks to a dastardly combination of sleep deprivation, a lack of preparation, inappopriate hiking footwear, horrendous fitness, and an extreme fog, the hike could definitely have been so much more comfortable and enjoyable. Was it worth it in the end though? All I can say is, I'm sort of glad I agreed to (or rather didn't fight too hard against) doing this, because it provided me with a sense of satisfication different to one derived from having seen a manta ray or mola.

Onto tackling Mount Kinabalu next, I guess?
