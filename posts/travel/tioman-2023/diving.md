Megan and I went to Tioman from 18-21 May for a little diving trip. We'd managed to snag good deals from ADEX this year and signed up with [Juara Scuba Academy](https://tiomanscubaacademy.com/). She took her SSI open water diving course while I went for a set of fun dives after unfortunately not having dived since 2021 due to COVID-19.

# Diving in Tioman

This was actually my second time to Tioman; the first was when I'd taken my advanced course way back in 2019. My trip this time took me to the east side of the island in Juara, whereas I'd gone to the west in Tekek in 2019. I'm not sure if it was because of the reefs recovering during the pandemic or what, but I felt like the marine life was way more abundant in the east compared to what I'd seen in the west in 2019. That, plus the slightly cooler water temperatures, made diving this time way more pleasant than the last time.

While I didn't get to see much in the way of pelagics, which I always love, there was such a huge variety of reef fish and healthy corals. The most memorable dive I did was definitely the night dive, because I got to see the transition in the fish's behaviour as the sun set. It looked like the end of a work day when everyone was going home! I even got to see things I hadn't before, like bigfin reef squid, and cleaner shrimp.

Unfortunately I have no pics of the dives nor did I bring my GoPro down because I was focusing on regaining confidence in my buoyancy. This has made me want to get an underwater photography setup really soon though...

# Food in Tioman 

The food here was nothing to write home about, and the "better" options certainly weren't that cheap (about 10-15 SGD per item). However, it was definitely still palatable, and the quiet nature of the island added to the chill vibes of dining here.

Can't really complain about $4 Kronenbergs either!

# Turtle?!

Possibly the coolest thing we saw during the trip was a turtle on land! We'd not managed to see one while diving, so experiencing this was made all the more special. Apparently, Juara is a breeding ground for turtles (it even has a turtle sanctuary) and this period was turtle hatching season. While strolling along the beach, we found a turtle digging sand, presumably to lay her (its?) eggs there.

# My thoughts

It's been quite a while since I'd last dived, so being underwater again felt like a breath of fresh air, both literally and figuratively. I'd missed this so much.

Also, even though we came to Tioman together, Meg and I couldn't dive together till the last day, so I'm hoping there's a future diving trip for us again and that this time, we will get to go on all the dives together :)
