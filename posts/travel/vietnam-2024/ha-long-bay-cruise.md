It was time for us to check out of our first hotel and to head to [*Ha Long Bay*](https://vietnam.travel/places-to-go/northern-vietnam/ha-long) for our overnight cruise. We went with [*Orchid Cruises*](https://www.orchidcruises.com/), as they seemed to have a nice balance between luxury, good reviews, and affordability. I was pretty stoked to go, as I've been constantly recommended to see this place in person, and I wanted to see what the fuss was about.

# Breakfast: Hotel

First things first though!

The selection didn't differ that much from the day before. Not saying it had to though; the spread was more than palatable enough. Megan and I had our satisfying fill before checking out and getting picked up by our transport to Ha Long.

# Harbour

It was a comfortable 3 hour drive to get to the harbour. There, we subsequently boarded a smaller boat, to then finally get on the cruise boat itself, which was docked slightly further away.

# Aboard the cruise

We were warmly welcomed by the entire crew as we approached the cruise boat. Upon boarding, we were ushered to our assigned seats in the dining area. The welcome drink was decent, and it was just the first of several more over the next two days.

We met with the cruise director, whose name I have forgotten. Megan seems to think it was *Happy*, while I think it was *Wan*. Pretty sure we're both wrong though. Anyway, he gave us a summary of the activities lined up.

More interestingly, he then told us when happy hour (1-for-1 drinks) was. Shortly after, we were given the keys to our room.

The room, much like our table in the dining area, had basically a full view of the bay. I really loved how wide the view was, as the room felt so much more open than if it had used regular windows instead. Megan and I would usually prefer to stay indoors if it was air-conditioned, but the balcony outside was too pleasant to not spend at least a few moments chilling in.

*I was very much looking forward to waking up to this in the morning!*

# Lunch

The cruise itinerary started on a great note with a nice multi-course lunch. We saw pretty good reviews online about this particular cruise's food, and at this point, we hadn't eaten much, so funnily enough, this was one of my most anticipated parts of the day.

![lunch-menu](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/ha-long-bay-cruise/lunch-menu.jpeg)

Admittedly, some of the dishes didn't seem to be "traditional" Vietnamese dishes and looked like they were designed to suit the more "touristy" palates, but [according to their website](https://www.orchidcruises.com/work/culinary-tasting/), the ingredients used included local flavours and spices.

## Chicken ravioli soup

We started with a simple soup that was thick and hearty. The ravioli was dense and left me wanting more.

## Spring rolls and salad

Our other appetiser included a pair of spring rolls and a beef banana blossom salad. While the salad was decent enough, I honestly was never a fan of Vietnamese spring rolls, and this time was no exception. I do like a herby flavour profile here and then, but the rolls just had too much of it.

## Cocktails!

We started taking advantage of happy hour and got ourselves a pair of cocktails. At the time of writing, I have already forgotten what the drink on the right was, but I do remember it being pretty good, and that's what's more important right?

## Mini seafood platter

I thought this dish was the standout among the other lunch offerings. The fish was tender, the oysters were relatively plump and drizzled with a delicious sauce, and while I normally dislike squid for being too chewy, the crunchy batter triumphed in this case.

## Pineapple fried rice with BBQ pork ribs

Serving the fried rice on a literal pineapple was an interesting aesthetic and culinary choice. The latter's tanginess contrasted well with the umami of the rice and ribs, both of which were flavourful.

![lunch-fried_rice](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/ha-long-bay-cruise/lunch-fried_rice.jpeg)

## Fruits

Fruits were sweet enough. I got to be extra full because Megan didn't wanna finish hers.

![lunch-fruit](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/ha-long-bay-cruise/lunch-fruit.jpeg)

Overall, Megan and I were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, as well as its quantity. I mean, I was pretty hungry at the start, but even I would have exploded if there was going to be another dish.

# Kayaking

One of the activities that didn't involve food gave us some time to kayak on the bay. The short route took Megan and I on a two-person kayak under some overhang appropriately called [*Dark-Light Cave*](https://vinpearl.com/en/dark-and-light-cave). On the other side, we reached a more remote part of the bay and took some time to enjoy the picturesque views from a different perspective. We weren't completely alone; there were lots of people but the I guess the bay was big enough to comfortably accommodate all of us.

This activity was basically a staple in the itineraries of all the cruise options I had browsed. On top of that, we ran into a lot of kayakers from other boats, so if for some reason, kayaking in Ha Long Bay is on your bucket list, crossing it off should be quite easy as soon as you plan to be in the area.

Our cruise director had been nice enough to take a picture of Megan and me, but we completely forgot to ask for it...

# More happy hour

There was another activity shortly after that involved swimming in the bay, but we decided to take a break from the saltwater and lounged at the jacuzzi instead, while once again taking advantage of the cheaper drinks.

# Cooking class: spring rolls

As a pre-dinner activity, our cruise director hosted a cooking demonstration, in which he showed us how to make Vietnamese spring rolls. I only realised then that at least in Vietnamese cuisine, there is [a distinction between spring and summer rolls](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/vietnam/articles/spring-rolls-and-summer-rolls-whats-the-difference).

![cooking_class](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/ha-long-bay-cruise/cooking_class.jpeg)

Apparently, a summer roll is the more well-known variant, and has the familiar translucent skin filled with fresh, raw vegetables that I'm not too fond of. This combination is supposed to cool you off during the hot summer. Conversely, a spring roll is deep fried and, while nutritionally less favourable, is more appropriate for the cooler spring season.

Our cruise director had a pretty good stage presence as he got some of us to participate in fun challenges during the rolling process. Not Megan and me though, we were shy and just blended in; I remember we were just sipping on some liquor.

*He made enough for everyone to have a taste!*

# Dinner

Megan and I had not yet "fully recovered" from the combination of lunch, happy hour and singular spring roll. Dinner was almost upon us, this time with a menu even more extensive than lunch's.

![dinner-menu](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/ha-long-bay-cruise/dinner-menu.jpeg)

## Seafood soup

We once again began with a soup. While it was nourishing, I preferred the one at lunch more.

![dinner-soup](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/ha-long-bay-cruise/dinner-soup.jpeg)

## Pork skewers

This was my favourite dinner dish! The pork was just sublime, and it was fun to create our own rolls with the rest of the ingredients provided. The [dipping sauce](https://www.wandercooks.com/nuoc-mam-cham/) was just the cherry on top.

![dinner-skewer](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/ha-long-bay-cruise/dinner-skewer.jpeg)

## Flamb√©ed prawns

The final presentation was admittedly unremarkable, but before being served, there was this over-the-top demonstration in which the chefs dimmed the lights and set the prawns alight. It was more of a spectacle than anything; the prawns tasted the same as any other.

![dinner-prawns](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/ha-long-bay-cruise/dinner-prawns.jpeg)

## Salmon with honey sauce

Our first of two mains was a sizeable pan-fried salmon. No complaints here, its texture and flavour were serviceable, especially when coupled with the sauce sitting underneath.

![dinner-salmon](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/ha-long-bay-cruise/dinner-salmon.jpeg)

## Chicken with rice and vegetables

We also had some grilled chicken with rice and vegetables, all of which were decent. At this point, I was already pretty full, so thankfully it was just dessert afterwards.

![dinner-chicken](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/ha-long-bay-cruise/dinner-chicken.jpeg)

## Coconut pudding

After a pretty intense umami overload, I was glad this dessert didn't disappoint. The pudding was rich in flavour, and while it didn't need them, the fruits on top and the cocoa powder on the side were welcome additions to the dish.

![dinner-pudding](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/ha-long-bay-cruise/dinner-pudding.jpeg)

## Bonus: vanilla cake

I thought we had finally conquered dinner, but then the lights dimmed again. The service crew came forward with a cake and started singing happy birthday to some other guest. Then they started serving cake slices... I thought, "There is no way I'd enjoy this given how full I am."

But I finished it anyway. It was good.

# Night festivities... or the lack thereof

After a very filling dinner, we were told about yet another well-known activity here: squid fishing. Megan and I had heard about it, and apparently it's really hard to catch even one. I wasn't a fan of squid nor fishing in general either, so we decided to give it a miss and just chill for the night, finally turning in at some point.

# My thoughts

Being situated at the heart of Ha Long Bay was definitely a unique enough experience. Even though we could see other cruise operators pretty much the whole time, they were sparse enough for me to immerse myself in the seemingly endless number of karsts. The fact that we did an overnight cruise meant that we could take our time to enjoy the view. And all while in relatively luxurious comfort too. Can't ask for much better honestly.
