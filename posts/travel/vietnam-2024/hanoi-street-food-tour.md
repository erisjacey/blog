Megan and I had short 5 day getaway in Vietnam's capital. It was the first time either of us would be visting the country (at least in quite a while), so we were both pretty excited for this trip.

Details to our itinerary can be found [in this Wanderlog page](https://wanderlog.com/view/bctntpugyo/trip-to-hanoi/shared).

# Lunch: Pizza 4P's

Several months ago, Megan's mum had brought back some pizza from [this place](https://pizza4ps.com/) from her own trip to Vietnam, and Megan claimed that it was the best pizza she had eaten. This sentiment was corroborated by quite a number of people online, so we decided to make this restaurant our first stop upon landing, even before going to our hotel. Thankfully, we had made a reservation as the place seemed to be busy when we arrived.

The interior design felt really cozy. I was particularly enamoured with the two giant stoves in which the pizza would be cooked.

We started with some fried chicken. It came in piping hot, the batter was crispier than average and the accompanying sauces were perfectly complementary. Can't complain about it at all.

Some time later though, the main event was finally here. We got a half-and-half pizza, with one side being the prosciutto & burrata, and the other being the garlic prawn. The former was indeed good, like the combination of cured meat + cheese usually is. I had expected it to be the superior one. I gotta say though, the latter was just so, so good. Every bite felt like a perfect harmony of taste and texture. I simply couldn't get enough of the sheer garlickiness of it all.

Needless to say, Pizza 4P's was 100% worth the hype, and ended up being my personal favourite restaurant in our trip.

Our total damage this time was ₫679,320 (~SG$36).

# A pleasant afternoon walk

After setting an excellent tone for the trip, we checked into our hotel and chilled a little, before heading out again to check out our surroundings. We were in the heart of [*the Old Quarter*](https://vietnam.travel/things-to-do/explore-old-quarter-your-way), possibly the most popular and touristy areas of Hanoi.

We spent about an hour or so walking around [*Hoàn Kiếm Lake*](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/hanoi/attractions/hoan-kiem-lake/a/poi-sig/1387763/357880), just soaking in the vibrant atmosphere and being among people who were doing the same.

# Food tour

It was around 5 PM, and about time for the [*food tour*](https://www.klook.com/en-SG/activity/1969-old-quarter-food-tour-hanoi/?spm=BookingDetail.ActivityCard&clickId=6dece20bab) that we had pre-booked on Klook. This private tour had a guide lead us on foot to various eateries within the Old Quarter, which were supposed to feature a good representation of the local fare here. As someone who is always on the lookout for new experiences, I was thrilled to do this.

Megan and I met with April, our guide for the evening, and made our way to our first of five stops.

## St. Joseph's Cathedral

While April was helping us make our orders, she encouraged us to check out [this cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Joseph%27s_Cathedral,_Hanoi) just right beside. It was the first really apparent reminder of the country's French colonial roots. I thought its architecture was pretty cool.

We also saw a mass service happening, which was also neat I guess.

## Bánh mì

Our first [bánh mì](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/187342/banh-mi/) from Vietnam itself! I thought the bread was really crunchy and appropriately buttered, and the filling was fresh. The sandwich on the whole was delicious.

As a side note, I absolutely love cilantro, but Megan *despises* it. So I guess it's a double-edged sword that a lot of Vietnamese dishes contain copious amounts of it. At least Megan got to learn another Vietnamese phrase by lack of choice.

![no_cilantro](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/hanoi-street-food-tour/no_cilantro.jpg)

Anyway, while we were munching on our food, we went from briefly talking about the local food scene, to talking about other cultural aspects about Vietnam in general. April told us some neat facts about the country's history surrounding [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%E1%BA%A1o_M%E1%BA%ABu) and language.

## Phở

Our next course took us to a local pho restaurant. Megan seemed to be really intrigued in our topics of discussion prior, so our food tour ended up becoming a cultural tour with several food stops spaced in between.

The two of us each got a bowl of [dry phở](https://tifflovestofu.com/main-dish/dry-pho-pho-kho-chay/), which was amazingly delectable, and a different enough take from the typical soupy version, and we also had some spring rolls. I was not a really huge fan of the latter to be honest.

![food_tour-pho](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/hanoi-street-food-tour/food_tour-pho.jpg)

This time, April began to talk about post colonial Vietnam, specifically regarding the [Vietnam War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Vietnam-War). She gave an interesting perspective of the events from the lens of someone who grew up in Northern Vietnam, and while I felt like some of her opinions had hints of biasness, I thought she was pretty objective overall. Regardless, her sharings were definitely informative and eye-opening.

## Bún chà

Our next dish was another savoury one, and this time it featured [Vietnamese meatballs alongside some rice noodles](https://www.recipetineats.com/bun-cha-vietnamese-meatballs/). The meat was excellent, and the mini-broth in which it was soaked was hearty. The noodles had a nice texture to them, and served as a great medium to eat with the soupy meatballs.

We also had some [bánh cuốn nóng](https://hanoitimes.vn/banh-cuon-hanoi-among-top-10-meals-of-the-world-in-2023-322908.html#:~:text=For%20the%20dish%20of%20banh,%2Dand%2Dsour%20dipping%20sauce.), which were basically some hot stuff rice crepes containing minced mushrooms. The crepes themselves were pretty bland, but tasted pretty good with the sweet-and-sour dipping sauce.

## Dessert: xôi chè bà cốt

We were already beginning to feel full, but it was finally time for some dessert. Our dessert restaurant was apparently well known for [xôi chè bà cốt](https://www.mazevietnam.com/2017/03/15/xoi-xoi-che/), which is a warm sweet soup combining steamed sticky rice and various other ingredients. This dish had one of the more unique flavours in the trip, and it reminded me of some other Indian desserts due to its "herby" nature.

We also had [tào phớ](https://indochinacharmtours.com/blog/tao-pho-a-popular-vietnamese-cooling-dish.html), which felt infinitely more familiar and refreshing. It is a tofu snack that is popular in Vietnam (and other countries in Asia), and it's a cold dessert, which meant that it was more appropriate in the summer heat, unlike the hot chè.

## Egg coffee

Our final stop had us try some [Vietnamese egg coffee](https://www.legalnomads.com/vietnamese-egg-coffee-recipe/). The main difference between this and the typical cup of coffee was obviously the egg yolk that engulfed the topmost surface of the drink. While I was eager to try it, it was already 8 PM, and I didn't want my sleep to be affected. April suggested we just have a cup to share though, since it was part of the package.

I thought the egg layer was thick and added a savoury hint to the drink. It didn't mix with the coffee really well, but I guess that's the intended effect. I liked it overall, but I didn't finish it.

![food_tour-egg_coffee](/images/posts/travel/vietnam-2024/hanoi-street-food-tour/food_tour-egg_coffee.jpg)

The past few hours had Megan and I feeling really stuffed, but at the same time sort of enlightened from hearing a Vietnamese local's thoughts and knowledge about the country's roots and history. We bade April farewell and walked around the area, which was still really lively, before heading back to our hotel to rest for the night.

# My thoughts

Our first day in a new country was really pleasant, and it drove home our common priority in all our trips so far: good food. Lunch was divine, even though it wasn't exactly Vietnamese food. Our evening food tour had a great combination of taking us to various parts of the Old Quarter, an introduction to "actual" local food, and some nice insights about the region's history. Hanoi so far was really enjoyable, and I was excited to explore and learn more about Vietnam.
