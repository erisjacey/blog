After a pretty long first day which included 4h of flying, today's itinerary didn't seem so bad. Megan and I had only planned to go to two museums and a [water puppet theatre show](https://thanglongwaterpuppet.com/), all of which were within the city center.

# Breakfast: Hotel

Having just slept off the gauntlet of traditional Vietnamese dishes the night prior, we gladly welcomed a more international breakfast spread at the hotel in which we were staying. Things like cured meats, bacon, and the more familiar maggi noodles just don't get old, do they?

Apart from the buffet, we were also given the choice of ordering a "main". We unfortunately didn't take a picture of what we had gotten, so I forgot what we chose. I did remember being really full and regretting ordering it though.

Anyway, we were obviously more than satisfied with breakfast, and had more than enough energy to go about the rest of our day.

# Ho Chi Minh Museum

[Our first stop of the day](https://vinpearl.com/en/ho-chi-minh-museum-explore-a-significant-cultural-relic-of-hanoi-capital) was a sprawling museum centered around the life of Ho Chi Minh, possibly the nation's most influential figure in the 20th century. We browsed an amalgamation of exhbits, ranging from the man's early years, to synopses of the various resistance wars that he led, all the way to a summary of the legacy and visions he had for Vietnam in his later years.

We spent a considerable amount of time at the exhbit showcasing [Vietnam's fight for independence from the French] from 1941 to 1954. It was intriguing to see glimpses of what must have been an immense effort to claim sovereignty of their own home.

I personally did not find the other parts of the museum as interesting, but I did notice and appreciate the attention to detail sprinkled throughout. There were three massive floors to get through, but each was distinct enough with different themes and all were easy enough to navigate.

My main takeway was that the Vietnamese were, and I guess still are, a fiercely proud nation, despite some regions' vast ideological and political differences, as well as the numerous obstacles (*cough, cough* colonialism) thrown their way.

# Ho Chi Minh's birthday

Coincidentally, today was the man's 134th birthday, and as suggested by our food tour guide yesterday, we thought of his final resting place in [Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum](https://vinpearl.com/en/ho-chi-minh-mausoleum-hanoi-the-final-resting-place-of-a-national-hero). It was especially convenient since the mausoleum was just right beside the museum.

Now, Ho Chi Minh's body can be seen on pretty much any other day as well. However, presumably because of today's signifance, the queue to enter the mausoleum that Megan and I were met with seemed to go on **forever**. 

# Hoa Lo Prison
