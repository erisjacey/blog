Today marked my first official full day in Europe. This was also our only full day in Dublin/Ireland, so what better way to make the most of it by going on a walking tour in the city centre? [Our original plan](https://www.theirishroadtrip.com/1-day-in-dublin/) had us going to other noteworthy places like [Trinity College for the Book of Kells exhibit](https://www.visittrinity.ie/book-of-kells-experience/), and the [GPO Museum](https://www.visitdublin.com/gpo-museum). Megan and I thought including all of them might be too overwhelming for our appetite for history, so we ended up skipping them. We just went for the places for which we had had booked tickets prior to the trip.

# Kilmainham Gaol

Our first stop needed us to be there by 9:25 AM. It was already 9 AM, and we made the executive decision to walk the 2km required to get there. Needless to say, I could not think of a better time to do a half-hour fast walk in the cold than the first time we stepped out of our hotel.

We did walk by some interesting sights at least!

![kilmainham-court](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/kilmainham-court.jpg)

[*Kilmainham Gaol*](https://www.kilmainhamgaolmuseum.ie/) was a prison-turned-museum that mostly held common criminals since its opening in 1796. Its most noteworthy role in history, however, was housing key political prisoners that played a part in the Irish republican insurrection known as the [1916 Easter Rising](https://www.britannica.com/event/Easter-Rising).

Our tour began in what would have been the gaol's courtroom. On a side note, the tickets were only €8/pax (which included the guided tour) but were very limited. I think this artifically-induced scarcity and the museum's nature of being an old prison made it more interesting as a place to visit in Dublin.

Some of the more interesting points our tour guide brought up were the fact that the gaol was designed with the intention of housing one prisoner per cell, although this was in practice rendered moot due to overcrowding. One particular event that exacerbated the problem was the [Great Famine](https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Famine-Irish-history) that actually caused people to commit crimes just to be able to be fed in prison.

![kilmainham-main](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/kilmainham-main.jpg)

This wing of the gaol was designed with a transparent ceiling, and its intention was supposedly to inspire the prisoners here. I don't know if it worked, but I guess it looked cool enough to be as this place's thumbnail on its website.

![kilmainham-courtyard](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/kilmainham-courtyard.jpg)

A significant portion of our tour guide's talking points were on the Easter Rising, and the personal stories of its 14 leaders, all of which I've already forgotten. However, the fact that their tales are still being echoed today is a testament to their significance in shaping Ireland today. And while I have a short memory span for some things, standing on the same grounds on which all of them were brutally executed will be definitely be etched in my memory.

All in all, I would say Kilmainham Gaol was an interesting way to learn about a key turning point in Irish history. Our guide was very informative, although at this point I still wasn't able to understand the Irish accent very well. I still am not to be honest.

![garden_walk](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/garden_walk.jpg)

After briefly going through the museum's exhibit, Megan and I took a pleasant and much more normally paced walk along a nice garden near the [Irish Museum of Modern Art](https://imma.ie/visit/info/) en route to our next stop.

# Guinness Storehouse

![guinness-outside](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/guinness-outside.jpg)

It only took us about 20 min to get to what is possibly [Dublin's most popular visitor attraction](https://www.guinness-storehouse.com/en/whats-hoppening/reasons-why-the-guinness-storehouse-is-the-best-visitor-attraction-in-dublin).

![guinness-sign](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/guinness-sign.jpg)

That being said, at around 11 AM, the queue to enter was practically non-existent.

![guinness-map](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/guinness-map.jpg)

The entrance of the place was very warmly adorned with Christmas decorations, which I simply could not get enough of. The very cutely designed map also made it seem like the storehouse was **sprawling** with various exhibits, although at the time I wasn't sure how they could have this many floors worth of content.

![guinness-ingredients](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/guinness-ingredients.jpg)

At the start of our self-guided tour, we were appopriately met with intricate displays showing off the four ingredients that made up a Guinness beer.

![guinness-fountain](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/guinness-fountain.jpg)

Each ingredient would be showcased in its own clever way in its own space. For example, there was a fancy shower fountain which would have the water fall periodically in the form of the Guinness harp symbol.

![guinness-cooperage](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/guinness-cooperage.jpg)

One interesting section of the *museum*, if you will, was the company's past dwellings in the cooperage trade. It was a term I had only seen playing city builder games in the medieval times, so it was cool to learn about and see historical footage of barrels being made by hand.

![guinness-tasting](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/guinness-tasting.jpg)

One thing that was mildly annoying when booking the tickets for this place was being thrown the opportunities for random add-ons, like having my portrait imprinted on the foam layer of the free pint of beer that came with the standard ticket. So I was glad that entering the tasting room came at no cost.

Here, Megan and I gathered a little about the different compositions of Guinness during the different parts of refinement. But the most interesting part was getting to sample a shot, and learning how to "properly" drink a Guinness. Apparently, we are supposed to take a sizeable enough gulp to drink from more than just the foamy layer. Below it was where the complex flavours were supposed to be.

I was just happy to have more free alcohol.

![guinness-observatory](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/guinness-observatory.jpg)

We eventually got to the observatory in the topmost floor. Here, our tour basically ended, but not without each redeeming the pint we were entitled to, and enjoying it with a view of the city surrounding us. I say *enjoy* with a small asterisk though, because it was honestly pretty hot in what was basically a greenhouse even with our coats off. Anyway, we didn't have much time to linger, because we had spent quite a bit of time here and it was already getting late for lunch.

On a side note, my alcohol tolerance had become so weak I actually already started feeling the effects from the single pint of beer. Didn't expect to cross day drinking in Europe off my checklist this trip. Sláinte!

![guinness-gate](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/guinness-gate.jpg)

On the whole, I thought it was interesting to learn more about Ireland's claim to global fame. The displays were very well presented and engaging enough. I even got to better appreciate the taste of stout beer, and I am usually more of a light beer person.

The whole experience, including a pint of Guinness, was around €26 per person.

# Lunch: The Brazen Head

We did a bit of shopping for a nice fridge magnet at the gift shop before heading further into the city centre.

![street](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/street.jpg)

The short walk sobered my weak self up and eventually landed us in [*Ireland's oldest pub*](https://brazenhead.com/), at least according to them. Though funnily enough, according to the *Guinness Book of Records*, that title belongs to [some place else](https://www.seansbar.ie/seans-bar-history#:~:text=Sean's%20Bar%20has%20been%20researched,nothing%20older%20has%20been%20found.).

![lunch-exterior](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/lunch-exterior.jpg)

On top of that, I've seen conflicting reviews online, i.e. mostly from self-proclaimed Reddit pundits, that this place was a tourist trap with gouged out prices, mediocre food and possibly terrible service.

In all honesty, I only read about the above literally as I am writing this, so I merely knew about the good parts that day.

![lunch-interior](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/lunch-interior.jpg)

I can't dispute that heavily against the comments on service. We weren't made to feel the most welcome, but it's not like we were refused seats and an order. Megan and I were still able to appreciate the interior design of the pub and receive our food in time, the latter of which was pretty important because we were **famished**.

![lunch-fish_and_chips](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/lunch-fish_and_chips.jpg)

I finally got my first *fish and chips* of the trip! I was very happy with the portions -- the fish was big, and the chips were so plentiful we could barely finish them.

Despite being a fish and chips aficionado, I admittedly had not had many in life. And maybe that's why I thought this was the best one I had so far. The fish was succulent and very expertly adhered to the batter, which was really light and crunchy. And the chips almost overshadowed their piscine counterpart, as I didn't know fried potato could be this delicious on its own. The accompanying tartar sauce was good enough, and the gourmet cherry on top was drizzling the whole ensemble with some dark malt vinegar to add a subtle but very welcome acidic flavour.

![lunch-beef_stew](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/lunch-beef_stew.jpg)

We also got their *beef stew*, which was supposed to be their signature dish. And yeah, I could honestly see (taste) it. The stew was hearty, the beef was tender and the mashed potato was creamy and perfectly complementary. I could go on, but I feel like I had already exhausted my vocabulary for food in my over-the-top description of the fish and chips.

Our total damage was €43, which I guess was pricey considering we didn't order any drinks. But we weren't too fussed; we were overall impressed by the food, tourist trap be damned. Honestly, if you liked the experience then it's not really a tourist trap, is it?

# Grafton Street

As mentioned, we decided to give the rest of the visitor attractions a miss and have a less guided itinerary for the rest of the day.

[*Grafton Street*](https://www.graftonstreet.ie/) is Dublin's main shopping street. We thought it was the perfect place to check out, considering we wanted to just stroll around and not have to read any more informational tablets, and it was right by our hotel. It turned out that both Megan and I wanted to each buy a new winter coat as well, so all signs were figuratively pointing towards it.

![grafton_street](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/grafton_street.jpg)

The street was surprisingly packed with more people than we had seen in Dublin up to this point. It was fun to see some busker at every corner, which coupled with the omnipresent Christmas lights, added to the vibrant atmosphere. We perused shops literally as the sun went down and the street lights turned on. Megan eventually found a coat she liked but I wasn't able to for myself. Guess I'd try again in Belfast or something.

# Dinner: Chinese delivery

We crashed at our hotel after about 26k steps in the day, which I'm aware was standard for travel, but for some reason I still felt like we deserved a treat. Because we were too lazy to head out again, we decided to order in some Chinese food that Megan had been seeing everywhere on Tiktok.

![dinner-crispy_fried_beef](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/dinner-crispy_fried_beef.jpg)

I guess they really did do things differently in Europe, because I had never seen *crispy fried beef* before in my Asian life. I thought the beef was tough, and it seemed like the chefs' aim was to make it saltier than it was tough. I gotta say, the flavour wasn't too bad though. Mostly a mix of chilli powder and salt.

![dinner-spice_box](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/dinner-spice_box.jpg)

The *spice box* was another dish that was Asian-but-uniquely-European. The same seasonings were used, just in a different but similarly-fried medium. Again, can't complain about salty fried food at the end of the day.

![dinner-rice_and_curry](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/dublin-walking-tour/dinner-rice_and_curry.jpg)

The *egg fried rice and curry sauce* were the most "normal" dishes. The fried rice, while looking like plain white rice from the picture, was pretty tasty, and had a bit of [wok hei](https://guide.michelin.com/en/article/dining-out/what-is-wok-hei). The curry was nice and paired well with all the food we got.

Our delivery cost €29. I had hoped the food would be cheaper and less salty, but at least the portions were so massive I was practically stuffing myself. I don't think I got this full from any other meal in Europe. Pretty sure I increased my risk of hypertension from this alone, but whatever.

# My thoughts

I was very satisfied with the things we chose to do and eat in our only day here. I know they're not close to the only things the city offers, but I really liked the takeaways I had from my figurative and literal taste of Dublin. The somber history of Ireland's major rebellion, the more lighthearted legacy of its famous beer, the charm of its streets and buildings, and of course, the fish and chips and other salty offerings.
