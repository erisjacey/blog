It was finally time to head to Europe!

This 14-day trip had been planned for several months at this point, and it felt like it took multiple "hurdles" to get here. Mostly mundane and ordinary things, like months of work with no vacation in between, and a couple of weeks of mandatory military service. But the day of Megan's and my flight was met with nothing but excitement for a new region, at least for me, in which to wholly immerse myself in its culture, history, and of course, cuisine.

The very final stretch was the actual getting here itself, and since it was my first time travelling this far, I had no idea what to expect. I had prepared myself to be jet lagged at the end, but no one told me how arduous the journey itself would be to have me feeling this way at the end. Our first layover at Doha took long enough to get to, and reaching our second stop at Heathrow had me completely sapped of energy.

However, upon landing in Dublin after a thankfully short and final flight, I remembered why I had been looking forward to this trip for so long. My first detractions that we were finally on vacation were: stepping out of the airport, putting on my winter coat, and soaking in the single-digit temperatures. Megan and I took a short bus ride to Dublin's city centre to check into [*Marlin Hotel*](https://www.marlin.com/dublin/), our choice of accommodations for our 2 days in Dublin.

# Dublin Castle Christmas market

The sun already set, and I had been fully expecting to not want to do **anything** and just crash for the night. Colour me very pleasantly surprised that both Megan and I were down to head out and check out what the city has to offer at night. Or maybe don't, because in retrospect, we were kinda hungry and the weather was so nice to go out for a walk.

Our only agenda of the day was [Dublin's main Christmas market](https://heritageireland.ie/whats-on/christmas-at-the-castle-2024/), situated on the grounds of Dublin Castle itself. I am aware that Christmas markets are a way bigger thing in places like Germany and Austria. And maybe it's because I've never been to any of them, or any of such markets ever, but I found Dublin's version to not be too shabby at all. The entrance to the market was relatively unassuming, but it was just a few steps in and I could already see several stalls adorned with festive lights. Before this, I had only seen them on my little phone screen, wishing I was there.

But here I finally was. I soaked in the jubilant atmosphere of it all. The giant Christmas tree in the middle of the castle. The smaller Christmas trees *everywhere*. The cobblestone streets, another sight I was weirdly excited for. The many, many Christmas decorations and ornaments scattered between the stalls. And to complete the scene, the fairly busy but not too overwhelming crowd with which I was sharing the night *(and also relatively overpriced food)*.

Speaking of the food, after a short reconnaissance of what the stores had to offer, Megan and I shared several bites to make up our dinner for the evening.

We first had a *potato stuffed with beans and cheese* (€8). While I thought the dish was nothing special, the spud was soft and had a nice mouth feel to it. It was the first of many potato dishes we would have in Ireland, which I came to realise were so much better here, but that's for future blog posts.

Before ordering, we had had in mind a couple of other things we wanted to try, but the stuffed potato was actually pretty filling, we had to re-evalute our strategy after.

We also shared a *bratwurst* in a hotdog bun (€10). The sausage was sufficiently thick and juicy, and the whole ensemble tasted like some upscale Ikea hotdog, and not in a reductive sense at all.

Our drink of choice was a cup of *mulled wine* (€7.50). I had not had it before, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought this hot alcoholic beverage was bitter at first, but it got interestingly sweeter with each successive sip. It also had a pretty nice aftertaste, and I could see why it was pretty much a staple of every Christmas market, with multiple stalls serving this drink.

Megan and I were both already full, so we decided to end our first food journey in Dublin with a *chocolate and marshmallow crepe* for dessert (€8). It tasted really sweet; the lady at the stall just kept pouring in more chocolate and marshmallows when I had thought she was done about midway through. While overwhelming, it was still a good meal to end on.

Afterwards, we continued to saunter on the castle grounds, slowly digesting the food we had eaten while lamenting the other foods our stomachs were no longer able to handle, all the while basking in the festive atmosphere a final time before heading back to our hotel.

# My thoughts

I wasn't the biggest fan of essentially the full 24-hour excursion, but finding myself in the streets of Dublin made the long hours of sitting and waiting completely worth it.

I was admittedly not the fondest of city travel either, but I now think that was just naivete on my end. I still think there are some undesirable aspects to it, like the inevitable dense crowds and requiring just one idiotic/inconsiderable tourist to ruin the experience. Though I guess if a place is popular, that usually means it's worth going to. And that's what made me turn my opinion around. I thought Dublin was a fairly charming city despite having only had an evening stroll in here so far, and was very enamored with how the city centre seemed to have a life of its own. I was very much looking forward to seeing more of it, along with learning more about Ireland's culture and history.
