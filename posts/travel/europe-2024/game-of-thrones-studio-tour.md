It was time to move on from our short stay in Dublin. We actually had not initially planned to come to the island of Ireland at all, and only decided to do so for the upcoming attraction, *after* we already booked our flight tickets to London.

The [*Game of Thrones Studio Tour*](https://gameofthronesstudiotour.com/) is located in Banbridge, Northern Ireland. It features sets, costumes, weapons and props that were actually used in the show. Scattered throughout exhibits were various bits of information detailing what went on behind the scenes. On top of all that, its status as the show's main filming studio further lends itself to its authenticity.

After a fairly short 1.5h bus ride from Dublin, Megan and I found ourselves at the entrance of the studio. I didn't even notice that we had passed the border and were now in the United Kingdom.

![lobby](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/lobby.jpg)

Immediately in the lobby, the stage had already been set, so to speak. A mini-display of the mannequins representing the Stark family greeted us. The staff were very welcoming and ushered us to the theatre, where our tour began.

The tour was going to immerse us in the most prominent parts of the show, from mainstay characters and iconic locations to unappreciated tidbits like the efforts that went behind making the show feel as lived-in as possible.

As a disclaimer, I actually had enough pictures of this tour to work with, so this blog post is going to be way more extensive that I had originally planned for.

# Beyond the Wall

After spending 10 min in the theatre watching a video introducing us to the show, its production and the tour itself, we were allowed to start roaming the studio on our own pace.

![beyond_the_wall-wights](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/beyond_the_wall-wights.jpg)

Our first area took us *beyond the Wall* and featured statues of the Night King and the freaky-looking wights.

![beyond_the_wall-wun_wun](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/beyond_the_wall-wun_wun.jpg)

The wildlings were also showcased and included the only giant depicted in the show.

# Production Design

![production_design](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/production_design.jpg)

The next section covered the various ways in which the fictional continent of Westeros was conceptualised. One example in which this was done was through the usage of miniature sets, in order to accurately display the production team's vision of certain places at a smaller scale.

# Art Department

![art_department](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/art_department.jpg)

Not sure if this was what one of the art department's offices was supposed to look like, but I thought this section was a fun enough addition.

# Castle Black

![castle_black](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/castle_black.jpg)

We were then taken further south (in the show) to *Castle Black*, and there we saw costumes from characters like Jon Snow, Alliser Thorne, and Melisandre.

# Set Decoration and Props

![set_decoration_and_props](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/set_decoration_and_props.jpg)

This next area was one of the first few instances of fun user interaction. On top of providing us with information about how *sets were decorated*, we were also given the creative freedom to design our own House sigils.

![set_decoration_and_props-sigil](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/set_decoration_and_props-sigil.jpg)

*Very creative indeed.*

![set_decoration_and_props-props](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/set_decoration_and_props-props.jpg)

Details on how the *props* were made were also shown, and prominent items such as dragon eggs were displayed.

# Studio Café

At this point, we already found ourselves at the halfway point of the studio tour, and there was a strategically placed café. Compared to the other one in the lobby, I mistakenly thought this was the smaller of the two, and so I thought we could just have a proper meal at the entrance once we were done with everything.

Turned out that the only place selling "proper meals" was this one. I guess it's okay because we inadvertently saved money this way.

# Winterfell

![winterfell-crypts](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/winterfell-crypts.jpg)

We officially passed the Wall and first entered *Winterfell* through its crypts, in which we saw statues of House Stark characters like the OG Ned Stark.

![winterfell-crypts_2](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/winterfell-crypts_2.jpg)

There also were statues of Jon, Arya and Sansa which were used in [the teaser for the travesty that was Season 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc8hmnqBBqY).

![winterfell-hall](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/winterfell-hall.jpg)

A few paces after found us in the Great Hall of Winterfell. The space was expertly used to showcase key scenes, such as the knighting of Brienne of Tarth.

# Dragonstone

![dragonstone-map_room](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/dragonstone-map_room.jpg)

We then landed in *Dragonstone*, the ancestral seat of House Targeryen. One corner of the room was reserved for its map room.

![dragonstone-throne_room](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/dragonstone-throne_room.jpg)

The other side of the room depicted its throne room, and it showed one of the bajillion costumes that Daenerys wore throughout the course of the show.

![balerion](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/balerion.jpg)

Adjacent to the map room was a display of various dragon skulls, including the mystical Balerion the Dread.

# Costume Shop

![costumes-daenerys](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/costumes-daenerys.jpg)

Shortly after Dragonstone was a small exhibit of the *costumes* of some important characters. Like this one of Daenerys (again) in the superior first half of the show.

![costumes-ar](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/costumes-ar.jpg)

In another short fun time killer, we were able to "dress up" and act as a member of the Kingsguard through a projected figure that mimicked our movements.

# Prosthetics Shop

![prosthetics-cersei](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/prosthetics-cersei.jpg)

There was a lot of information on how *prosthetics* were created and used, and we could marvel at the lifelike creations of Cersei and Jaime in a particular scene. While ignoring its exact context of course, because of how stupid it was.

![prosthetics-ar](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/prosthetics-ar.jpg)

Yet another fun interactive allowed us to wear the makeup of a white walker, the result of which apparently can be used as your new social media profile picture if you don't take yourself seriously.

![prosthetics-freaks](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/prosthetics-freaks.jpg)

*Revisiting wights and wildlings again, this time in the context of prosthetics and makeup!*

# Hall of Faces

![hall_of_faces](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/hall_of_faces.jpg)

One of the more confusing parts of the show without reading into it was the *Hall of Faces*. This room was pretty small, but there was an opportunity to *subvert expectations* ourselves and plaster our happy faces onto what was supposed to be pillars of dead people's faces.

# Armoury Workshop

![armoury_workshop-scorpion](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/armoury_workshop-scorpion.jpg)

Past the previous room was a showcase of the different *weaponry and armour* used in the show. This included the weapon used by the fleet that *Dany kinda forgot about*.

![armoury_workshop](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/armoury_workshop.jpg)

This had rung true throughout the tour but the props did look authentic!

# Filming Locations

![film_locations](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/film_locations.jpg)

I was already fairly aware of some of the *places in which the show was filmed*. What I didn't know was Spain being heavily used as well.

A trip to Dubrovnik soon to see King's Landing, maybe?

# Tommen's Chamber

![tommens_chamber](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/tommens_chamber.jpg)

Interestingly, *Tommen's chamber* was singled out in the tour. Maybe whoever designed this studio tour wanted to highlight the allegory that was the figurative downfall of the show's quality in Season 6.

# The Red Keep

![red_keep-small_council_chamber](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/red_keep-small_council_chamber.jpg)

Aptly enough, one of the final rooms featured *the kingdom's capital*. Much of this area, from the small council chamber to the map courtyard, seemed to be lifted straight from the many show scenes. As long as I ignored the blank faces of the few mannequins here, I could almost feel all the conniving, scheming and backstabbing. Like when I was betrayed by the writers when rocks of all things killed some of the major characters in Season 8.

![red_keep-map_courtyard](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/red_keep-map_courtyard.jpg)

# Throne Room

The very last section featured the *Iron Throne* itself. The most iconic sight of the show, reduced to rubble in the one of its final scenes. The set was an impressive sight, the marvel of which unfortunately contrasted its usage of being one of the most disappointing scenes in the series. 

![throne_room](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/throne_room.jpg)

# Lunch: Lobby Café

After spending our last few moments looking around, Megan and I left Westeros and found ourselves in the gift shop.

![lunch](/images/posts/travel/europe-2024/game-of-thrones-studio-tour/lunch.jpg)

We bought some frankly overpriced fridge magnets and keychains and headed back to the lobby café, where we got ourselves some snacks, which, while also expensive (£28), had to suffice for lunch. We chilled for a while waiting for our next bus to come in order to make it to Belfast, our next stop for the trip.

# My thoughts

I didn't hide my dismay about how the show was treated in its latter seasons. It definitely resulted in my apathy for the story post-finale. That being said, and my constant snark throughout this blog post aside, I was still able to appreciate the immense effort that went into making possibly the greatest pop culture sensation, at least for a brief period of time. The writing in the last few seasons indeed marred the reputation of Game of Thrones, but it couldn't erase the fact that many ridiculous trends began, like [naming your children Arya and Khaleesi](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/18pus2k/analysis_of_got_names_data_in_the_us_between/). In a way, this studio tour softened the blow of the terrible writing a little bit, because I got to see in person the other aspects that made the show such a huge global icon.

The package we got needed us to complete the tour in 3 hours, which was more than enough time. I also thought the admission price of £55/person was fair, as this price point included transfers from Dublin and to Belfast. The experience was worth it for any Game of Thrones fan in my opinion. Even if you got disgruntled in the end.
